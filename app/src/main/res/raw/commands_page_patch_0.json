 <br><br>Pacman is a package management utility that tracks installed packages on a Linux
 system. It features dependency support, package groups, install and uninstall
 scripts, and the ability to sync your local machine with a remote repository to
 automatically upgrade packages. Pacman packages are a zipped tar format.
 <br><br>Since version 3.0.0, pacman has been the front-end to <a href=libalpm.3.html>libalpm(3)</a>, the
 “Arch Linux Package Management” library. This library allows alternative
 front-ends to be written (for instance, a GUI front-end).
 <br><br>Invoking pacman involves specifying an operation with any potential options and
 targets to operate on. A target is usually a package name, file name, URL, or
 a search string. Targets can be provided as command line arguments.
 Additionally, if stdin is not from a terminal and a single hyphen (-) is passed
 as an argument, targets will be read from stdin.

 <p>
         Operate on the package database. This operation allows you to modify
         certain attributes of the installed packages in pacman’s database. It
         also allows you to check the databases for internal consistency.
         See <a href=#DO>Database Options</a> below.
 </p>
 <p>
         Query the package database. This operation allows you to view installed
         packages and their files, as well as meta-information about individual
         packages (dependencies, conflicts, install date, build date, size). This
         can be run against the local package database or can be used on
         individual package files. In the first case, if no package names
         are provided in the command line, all installed packages will be
         queried. Additionally, various filters can be applied on the package
         list. See <a href=#QO>Query Options</a> below.
 </p>
 <p>
         Remove package(s) from the system. Groups can also be specified to be
         removed, in which case every package in that group will be removed.
         Files belonging to the specified package will be deleted, and the
         database will be updated. Most configuration files will be saved
         with a .pacsave extension unless the --nosave option is used.
         See <a href=#RO>Remove Options</a> below.
 </p>
 <p>
         Synchronize packages. Packages are installed directly from the remote
         repositories, including all dependencies required to run the packages. For
         example, pacman -S qt will download and install qt and all the
         packages it depends on. If a package name exists in more than one
         repository, the repository can be explicitly specified to clarify the
         package to install: pacman -S testing/qt. You can also specify version
         requirements: pacman -S bash&gt;=3.2. Quotes are needed, otherwise the
         shell interprets &gt; as redirection to a file.
 </p>
 <p>In addition to packages, groups can be specified as well. For example, if
 gnome is a defined package group, then pacman -S gnome will provide a
 prompt allowing you to select which packages to install from a numbered list.
 The package selection is specified using a space- and/or comma-separated list of
 package numbers. Sequential packages may be selected by specifying the first
 and last package numbers separated by a hyphen (-). Excluding packages is
 achieved by prefixing a number or range of numbers with a caret (^).</p>
 <p>Packages that provide other packages are also handled. For example, pacman -S
 foo will first look for a foo package. If foo is not found, packages that
 provide the same functionality as foo will be searched for. If any package is
 found, it will be installed. A selection prompt is provided if multiple packages
 providing foo are found.</p>
 <p>You can also use pacman -Su to upgrade all packages that are out-of-date. See
 <a href=#SO>Sync Options</a> below. When upgrading, pacman performs version comparison
 to determine which packages need upgrading. This behavior operates as follows:</p>


 Alphanumeric:
   1.0a &lt; 1.0b &lt; 1.0beta &lt; 1.0p &lt; 1.0pre &lt; 1.0rc &lt; 1.0 &lt; 1.0.a &lt; 1.0.1
 Numeric:
   1 &lt; 1.0 &lt; 1.1 &lt; 1.1.1 &lt; 1.2 &lt; 2.0 &lt; 3.0.0

 <p>Additionally, version strings can have an epoch value defined that will
 overrule any version comparison, unless the epoch values are equal. This is
 specified in an epoch:version-rel format. For example, 2:1.0-1 is always
 greater than 1:3.6-1.</p>
 <p>
         Check dependencies; this is useful in scripts such as makepkg to check
         installed packages. This operation will check each dependency specified and
         return a list of dependencies that are not currently satisfied on the system.
         This operation accepts no other options. Example usage: pacman -T qt
         bash&gt;=3.2.
 </p>
 <p>
         Upgrade or add package(s) to the system and install the required
         dependencies from sync repositories. Either a URL or file path can be
         specified. This is a “remove-then-add” process. See <a href=#UO>Upgrade         Options</a> below; also see <a href=#HCF>Handling Config Files</a> for an explanation
         on how pacman takes care of configuration files.
 </p>
 <p>
         Query the files database. This operation allows you to look for packages
         owning certain files or display files owned by certain packages. Only
         packages that are part of your sync databases are searched. See
         <a href=#FO>File Options</a> below.

 <p>
         Display version and exit.

         Display syntax for the given operation. If no operation was supplied,
         then the general syntax is shown.

 <p>
         Specify an alternative database location (a typical default is
         /var/lib/pacman). This should not be used unless you know what
         you are doing.
         NOTE: If specified, this is an absolute path, and the root path is
         not automatically prepended.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify an alternative installation root (default is /). This should
         not be used as a way to install software into /usr/local instead of
         /usr. This option is used if you want to install a package on a
         temporarily mounted partition that is owned by another system.
         NOTE: If database path or log file are not specified on either the
         command line or in <a href=pacman.conf.5.html>pacman.conf(5)</a>, their default location will
         be inside this root path.
 </p>
 <p>
         Output paths such as as the Root, Conf File, DB Path, Cache Dirs, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify an alternate architecture.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify an alternative package cache location (a typical default is
         /var/cache/pacman/pkg). Multiple cache directories can be
         specified, and they are tried in the order they are passed to pacman.
         NOTE: This is an absolute path, and the root path is not automatically
         prepended.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify when to enable coloring. Valid options are always, never, or
         auto. always forces colors on; never forces colors off; and auto only
         automatically enables colors when outputting onto a tty.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify an alternate configuration file.
 </p>
 <p>
         Display debug messages. When reporting bugs, this option is recommended
         to be used.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify a directory of files used by GnuPG to verify package signatures (a
         typical default is /etc/pacman.d/gnupg). This directory should contain
         two files: pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg. pubring.gpg holds the public keys
         of all packagers. trustdb.gpg contains a so-called trust database, which
         specifies that the keys are authentic and trusted. NOTE: This is an absolute
         path, and the root path is not automatically prepended.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify a alternative directory containing hook files (a typical default is
         /etc/pacman.d/hooks). Multiple hook directories can be specified
         with hooks in later directories taking precedence over hooks in earlier
         directories. NOTE: This is an absolute path, and the root path is not
         automatically prepended.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify an alternate log file. This is an absolute path, regardless of
         the installation root setting.
 </p>
 <p>
         Bypass any and all “Are you sure?” messages. It’s not a good idea to do
         this unless you want to run pacman from a script.

 <p>
         Skips dependency version checks. Package names are still checked. Normally,
         pacman will always check a package’s dependency fields to ensure that all
         dependencies are installed and there are no package conflicts in the
         system. Specify this option twice to skip all dependency checks.
 </p>
 <p>
         Add a virtual package package with version version to the transaction
         to satisfy dependencies. This allows to disable specific dependency checks
         without affecting all dependency checks. To disable all dependency
         checking, see the --nodeps option.
 </p>
 <p>
         Adds/removes the database entry only, leaving all files in place.
 </p>
 <p>
         Do not show a progress bar when downloading files. This can be useful
         for scripts that call pacman and capture the output.
 </p>
 <p>
         If an install scriptlet exists, do not execute it. Do not use this
         unless you know what you are doing.
 </p>
 <p>
         Only print the targets instead of performing the actual operation (sync,
         remove or upgrade). Use --print-format to specify how targets are
         displayed. The default format string is %l, which displays URLs with
         -S, file names with -U, and pkgname-pkgver with -R.
 </p>
 <p>
         Specify a printf-like format to control the output of the --print
         operation. The possible attributes are: %n for pkgname, %v for pkgver,
         %l for location, %r for repository, and %s for size. Implies --print.

 <p>
         Bypass file conflict checks and overwrite conflicting files. If the
         package that is about to be installed contains files that are already
         installed, this option will cause all those files to be overwritten.
         Using --force will not allow overwriting a directory with a file or
         installing packages with conflicting files and directories.
         This option should be used with care, ideally not at all.
 </p>
 <p>
         Install packages non-explicitly; in other words, fake their install reason
         to be installed as a dependency. This is useful for makepkg and other
         build-from-source tools that need to install dependencies before building
         the package.
 </p>
 <p>
         Install packages explicitly; in other words, fake their install reason to
         be explicitly installed. This is useful if you want to mark a dependency
         as explicitly installed so it will not be removed by the --recursive
         remove operation.

         Check that all files owned by the given package(s) are present on the

         Show less information for certain query operations. This is useful when
         pacman’s output is processed in a script. Search will only show package
         names and not version, group, and description information; owns will
         only show package names instead of file is owned by pkg messages; group
         will only show package names and omit group names; list will only show
         files and omit package names; check will only show pairs of package names
         and missing files; a bare query will only show package names
         rather than names and versions.

 <p>
         Search each locally-installed package for names or descriptions that
         match regexp. When including multiple search terms, only packages
         with descriptions matching ALL of those terms are returned.
 </p>
 <p>
         Restrict or filter output to packages not required or optionally required by
         any currently installed package. Specify this option twice to only filter
         packages that are direct dependencies (i.e. do not filter optional
         dependencies).
 </p>
 <p>
         Restrict or filter output to packages that are out-of-date on the local
         system. Only package versions are used to find outdated packages;

         Remove packages that are no longer installed from the cache as well as
         currently unused sync databases to free up disk space. When pacman

         databases are saved for every sync DB you download from and are not
         deleted even if they are removed from the configuration file
         <a href=pacman.conf.5.html>pacman.conf(5)</a>. Use one --clean switch to only remove
         packages that are no longer installed; use two to remove all files

 <br><br>Pacman uses the same logic as rpm to determine action against files that are
 designated to be backed up. During an upgrade, three MD5 hashes are used for
 each backup file to determine the required action: one for the original file
 installed, one for the new file that is about to be installed, and one for the
 actual file existing on the file system. After comparing these three hashes, the
 follow scenarios can result:
 <p>
         All three files are the same, so overwrites are not an issue. Install the
         new file.
 </p>
 <p>
         The current file is the same as the original, but the new one differs.
         Since the user did not ever modify the file, and the new one may contain
         improvements or bug fixes, install the new file.
 </p>
 <p>
         Both package versions contain the exact same file, but the one on the
         file system has been modified. Leave the current file in place.
 </p>
 <p>
         The new file is identical to the current file. Install the new file.
 </p>
 <p>
         All three files are different, so install the new file with a .pacnew
         extension and warn the user. The user must then manually merge any
         necessary changes into the original file.
 </p>
 <p>
         The package was not previously installed, and the file already exists on the

         user. The user must then manually merge any necessary changes into the

 <br><br>Computes multiple hashes, or message digests, for any number of files while optionally recursively digging through the directory structure. By default the
 program computes MD5 and SHA-256 hashes, equivalent to -c md5,sha256. Can also take a list of known hashes and display the filenames of input files whose
 hashes either do or do not match any of the known hashes. Can also use a list of known hashes to audit a set of FILES. Errors are reported to standard error.
 If no FILES are specified, reads from standard input.
 -c &lt;alg1&gt;[,&lt;alg2&gt;...]
 Computation mode. Compute hashes of FILES using the algorithms specified. Legal values are md5, sha1, sha256, tiger, and whirlpool.-k

 <br><br>Load a file of known hashes. This flag is required when using any of the matching or audit modes (i.e. -m, -x, -M, -X, or -a) This flag may be used more
 than once to add multiple sets of known hashes.Loading sets with different hash algorithms can sometimes generate spurrious hash collisions. For example, lets say we have two hash sets, A and B, which
 have some overlapping files. For example, the file /usr/bin/bad is in both sets. In A weve recorded the MD5 and SHA-256. In B weve recorded the MD5, SHA-1,
 and SHA-256. Because these two records are different, they will both be loaded. When the program computes all three hashes and compares them to the set of
 knowns, we will get an exact match from the record in B and a collision from the record in A.
 -a

 <br><br>Audit mode. Each input file is compared against the set of knowns. An audit is said to pass if each input file is matched against exactly one file in set of
 knowns. Any collisions, new files, or missing files will make the audit fail. Using this flag alone produces a message, either Audit passed or Audit
 Failed. Use the verbose modes, -v, for more details. Using -v prints the number of files in each category. Using -v a second time prints any discrepancies.
 Using -v a third time prints the results for every file examined and every known file.Due to limitations in the program, any filenames with Unicode characters will appear to have moved during an audit. See the section UNICODE SUPPORT
 below.-m

 <br><br>Positive matching, requires at least one use of the -k flag. The input files are examined one at a time, and only those files that match the list of known
 hashes are output. The only acceptable format for known hashes is the output of previous hashdeep runs.If standard input is used with the -m flag, displays stdin if the input matches one of the hashes in the list of known hashes. If the hash does not match,
 the program displays no output.
 <p>This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -x, -X, or -a flags. See the section UNICODE SUPPORT below.
 </p>-x

 <br><br>Negative matching. Same as the -m flag above, but does negative matching. That is, only those files NOT in the list of known hashes are displayed.This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -m, -M, or -a flags. See the section UNICODE SUPPORT below.-w

 <br><br>When used with positive matching modes (-m,-M) displays the filename of the known hash that matched the input file. See the section UNICODE SUPPORT
 below.-M and -X
 Same as -m and -x above, but displays the hash for each file that does (or does not) match the list of known hashes.-r

 <br><br>Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed. Please note that recursive mode cannot be used to examine all files of a given file extension. For
 example, calling hashdeep -r *.txt will examine all files in directories that end in .txt.<br><br><b>-e</b><br><br>Displays a progress indicator and estimate of time remaining for each file being processed. Time estimates for files larger than 4GB are not available on
 Windows. This mode may not be used with th -p mode.-i &lt;size&gt;
 Size threshold mode. Only hash files smaller than the given the threshold. Sizes may be specified using multiplers b,k,m,g,t,p, and e.-o <bcpflsd>
 Enables expert mode. Allows the user specify which (and only which) types of files are processed. Directory processing is still controlled with the -r flag.
 The expert mode options allowed are:<br>
 f - Regular files<br>
 b - Block Devices<br>
 c - Character Devices<br>
 p - Named Pipes<br>
 l - Symbolic Links<br>
 s - Sockets<br>
 d - Solaris Doors-s

 <br><br>Enables silent mode. All error messages are supressed.<br><br><b>-p</b><br><br>Piecewise mode. Breaks files into chunks before hashing. Chunks may be specified using multiplers b,k,m,g,t,p, and e. (Never let it be said that the author
 didnt plan ahead.)<br><br><b>-b</b><br><br>Enables bare mode. Strips any leading directory information from displayed filenames. This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -l flag.<br><br><b>-l</b><br><br>Enables relative file paths. Instead of printing the absolute path for each file, displays the relative file path as indicated on the command line. This
 flag may not be used in conjunction with the -b flag.<br><br><b>-v</b><br><br>Enables verbose mode. Use again to make the program more verbose.

 "},{"id": 18228,"commandid" : 2423,"title": "Description","page": "


 <br><br>The libwww-perl collection is a set of Perl modules which provides a simple and consistent application programming interface ( API ) to the
 World-Wide Web. The main focus of the library is to provide classes and functions that allow you to write WWW clients. The library also contain
 modules that are of more general use and even classes that help you implement simple HTTP servers.<br><br>Most modules in this library provide an object oriented API . The user agent, requests sent and responses received from the
 WWW server are all represented by objects. This makes a simple and powerful interface to these services. The interface is easy to extend and
 customize for your own needs.<br><br>The main features of the library are:
 <br><br>• Provides an object oriented model of HTTP-style communication. Within this framework we currently support access to http, https, gopher, ftp, news, file,
 and mailto resources.<br><br>• Provides a full object oriented interface or a very simple procedural interface.<br><br>• Supports the basic and digest authorization schemes.<br><br>• Supports transparent redirect handling.<br><br>• Supports access through proxy servers.<br><br>• Provides parser for robots.txt files and a framework for constructing robots.<br><br>• Supports parsing of HTML forms.<br><br>• Implements HTTP content negotiation algorithm that can be used both in protocol modules and in server scripts (like CGI
 scripts).<br><br>• Supports HTTP cookies.<br><br>• Some simple command line clients, for instance lwp-request and lwp-download.
 "},{"id": 18229,"commandid" : 2423,"title": "Http Style Communication","page": "

 <br><br>The libwww-perl library is based on HTTP style communication. This section tries to describe what that means.<br><br>Let us start with this quote from the HTTP specification document &lt;URL:<a href=http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/</a>&gt;:
 <br><br>For example, if we want to fetch a document from a remote file server, then we send it a request that contains a name for that document and the response
 will contain the document itself. If we access a search engine, then the content of the request will contain the query parameters and the response will contain
 the query result. If we want to send a mail message to somebody then we send a request object which contains our message to the mail server and the response
 object will contain an acknowledgment that tells us that the message has been accepted and will be forwarded to the <b>recipient</b>(s).<br><br>It is as simple as that!

 <br><br><b>The Request Object</b>
 <br><br>The main attributes of the request objects are:• The method is a short string that tells what kind of request this is. The most common methods are GET ,
 PUT , POST and HEAD .

 <br><br>• The <b>uri</b> is a string denoting the protocol, server and the name of the document we want to access. The <b>uri</b> might also encode various other
 parameters.<br><br>• The <b>headers</b> contain additional information about the request and can also used to describe the content. The headers are a set of keyword/value pairs.<br><br>• The <b>content</b> is an arbitrary amount of data.

 <br><br><b>The Response Object</b>
 code is a numerical value that indicates the overall outcome of the request.

 <br><br>• The <b>message</b> is a short, human readable string that corresponds to the code.<br><br>• The <b>headers</b> contain additional information about the response and describe the content.<br><br>• The <b>content</b> is an arbitrary amount of data.Since we dont want to handle all possible The request was was successfully received, understood or accepted.is_error()The request failed. The server or the resource might not be available, access to the resource might be denied or other things might have failed for some
 reason.

 <br><br><b>The User Agent</b>
 <br><br>The answer is that you pass it to a user agent object and this object takes care of all the things that need to be done (like low-level communication
 and error handling) and returns a response object. The user agent represents your application on the network and provides you with an interface that can
 accept requests and return responses.<br><br>The user agent is an interface layer between your application code and the network. Through this interface you are able to access the various servers on the
 network.<br><br>The class name for the user agent is LWP::UserAgent. Every libwww-perl application that wants to communicate should create at least one object of
 this class. The main method provided by this object is request(). This method takes an HTTP::Request object as argument and (eventually)
 returns a HTTP::Response object.<br><br>The user agent has many other attributes that let you configure how it will interact with the network and with your application.• The timeout specifies how much time we give remote servers to respond before the library disconnects and creates an internal <br><br>• The <b>agent</b> specifies the name that your application should use when it presents itself on the network.<br><br>• The <b>from</b> attribute can be set to the e-mail address of the person responsible for running the application. If this is set, then the address will be
 sent to the servers with every request.<br><br>• The <b>parse_head</b> specifies whether we should initialize response headers from the &lt;head&gt; section of HTML documents.<br><br>• The <b>proxy</b> and <b>no_proxy</b> attributes specify if and when to go through a proxy server. &lt;URL:<a href=http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Proxies/>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Proxies/</a>&gt;<br><br>• The <b>credentials</b> provide a way to set up user names and passwords needed to access certain services.Many applications want even more control over how they interact with the network and they get this by sub-classing <br><br><b>An Example</b>
 http://search.cpan.org/search);
 $req->content_type(application/x-www-form-urlencoded);
 $req->content(query=libwww-perl&mode=dist);

 # Pass request to the user agent and get a response back
 my $res = $ua->request($req);

 # Check the outcome of the response
 if ($res->is_success) {
     print $res->content;
 }
 else {
     print $res->status_line, \n;
 }"},{"id": 18230,"commandid" : 2423,"title": "Network Support","page": "

 <br><br>This section discusses the various protocol schemes and the HTTP style methods that headers may be used for each.<br><br>For all requests, a User-Agent header is added and initialized from the $ua-&gt;agent attribute before the request is handed to the network
 layer. In the same way, a From header is initialized from the $ua-&gt;from attribute.<br><br>For all responses, the library adds a header called Client-Date. This header holds the time when the response was received by your application. The format
 and semantics of the header are the same as the server created Date header. You may also encounter other Client-XXX headers. They are all generated by the
 library internally and are not received from the servers.<br><br><b>HTTP Requests</b>
 <br><br>If the server is not available then the library will generate an internal error response.<br><br>The library automatically adds a Host and a Content-Length header to the HTTP request before it is sent over the network.<br><br>For a GET request you might want to add a If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match header to make the request conditional.<br><br>For a POST request you should add the Content-Type header. When you try to emulate HTML &lt; FORM &gt;
 handling you should usually let the value of the Content-Type header be application/x-www-form-urlencoded. See lwpcook for examples of this.<br><br>The libwww-perl HTTP implementation currently support the HTTP/1 .1 and HTTP/1 .0 protocol.<br><br>The library allows you to access proxy server through HTTP . This means that you can set up the library to forward all types of request
 through the HTTP protocol module. See LWP::UserAgent for documentation of this.

 <br><br><b>HTTPS Requests</b>
 <br><br>The request can contain the header If-SSL-Cert-Subject in order to make the request conditional on the content of the server certificate. If the
 certificate subject does not match, no request is sent to the server and an internally generated error response is returned. The value of the
 If-SSL-Cert-Subject header is interpreted as a Perl regular expression.

 <br><br><b>FTP Requests</b>
 <br><br>You can specify a ftp account for servers that want this in addition to user name and password. This is specified by including an Account header in the
 request.<br><br>User name/password can be specified using basic authorization or be encoded in the URL . Failed logins return an UNAUTHORIZED
 response with WWW-Authenticate: Basic and can be treated like basic authorization for HTTP .<br><br>The library supports ftp ASCII transfer mode by specifying the type=a parameter in the URL . It also supports transfer of
 ranges for FTP transfers using the Range header.<br><br>Directory listings are by default returned unprocessed (as returned from the ftp server) with the content media type reported to be text/ftp-dir-listing.
 The File::Listing module provides methods for parsing of these directory listing.<br><br>The ftp module is also able to convert directory listings to HTML and this can be requested via the standard HTTP content
 negotiation mechanisms (add an Accept: text/html header in the request if you want this).<br><br>For normal file retrievals, the Content-Type is guessed based on the file name suffix. See LWP::MediaTypes.<br><br>The If-Modified-Since request header works for servers that implement the MDTM command. It will probably not work for directory listings
 though.<br><br>Example:$req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => ftp://me:passwd@ftp.some.where.com/);
 $req->header(Accept => text/html, */*;q=0.1);<br><br><b>News Requests</b>
 <br><br>The library supports GET and HEAD to retrieve news articles through the NNTP protocol. You can also post
 articles to newsgroups by using (surprise!) the POST method.<br><br>GET on newsgroups is not implemented yet.<br><br>Examples:$req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => news:abc1234@a.sn.no);

 $req = HTTP::Request->new(POST => news:comp.lang.perl.test);
 $req->header(Subject => This is a test,
              From    => me@some.where.org);
 $req->content(<<EOT);
 This is the content of the message that we are sending to
 the world.
 EOT<br><br><b>Gopher Request</b>
 <br><br>Gopher menus are always converted to HTML .<br><br>The response Content-Type is generated from the document type encoded (as the first letter) in the request URL path itself.<br><br>Example:$req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => gopher://gopher.sn.no/);<br><br><b>File Request</b>
 <br><br>Directories are always converted to an HTML document. For normal files, the Content-Type and Content-Encoding in the response are guessed
 based on the file suffix.<br><br>Example:$req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => file:/etc/passwd);<br><br><b>Mailto Request</b>
 <br><br>Example:$req = HTTP::Request->new(POST => mailto:libwww@perl.org);
 $req->header(Subject => subscribe);
 $req->content(Please subscribe me to the libwww-perl mailing list!\n);<br><br><b>CPAN Requests</b>

 <br><br><b>Sendmail</b> sends a message to one or more recipients, routing the message over whatever networks are necessary. <b>Sendmail</b> does
 internetwork forwarding as necessary to deliver the message to the correct place.<br><br><b>Sendmail</b> is not intended as a user interface routine; other programs provide user-friendly front ends; <b>sendmail</b> is used only to deliver
 pre-formatted messages.<br><br>With no flags, <b>sendmail</b> reads its standard input up to an end-of-file or a line consisting only of a single dot and sends a copy of the message found
 there to all of the addresses listed. It determines the <b>network</b>(s) to use based on the syntax and contents of the addresses.<br><br>Local addresses are looked up in a file and aliased appropriately. Aliasing can be prevented by preceding the address with a backslash. Beginning with 8.10,
 the sender is included in any alias expansions, e.g., if john sends to group, and group includes john in the expansion, then the letter will also be
 delivered to john.<br><br><b>Parameters</b>
 -Ac

 <br><br>Use submit.cf even if the operation mode does not indicate an initial mail submission.<br><br><b>-Am</b><br><br>Use sendmail.cf even if the operation mode indicates an initial mail submission.<br><br><b>-B</b>type<br><br>Set the body type to type. Current legal values are 7BIT or 8BITMIME.<br><br><b>-ba</b><br><br>Go into ARPANET mode. All input lines must end with a CR-LF, and all messages will be generated with a CR-LF at the end. Also, the From: and Sender:
 fields are examined for the name of the sender.<br><br><b>-bd</b><br><br>Run as a daemon. <b>Sendmail</b> will fork and run in background listening on socket 25 for incoming SMTP connections. This is normally run from /etc/rc.<br><br><b>-bD</b><br><br>Same as <b>-bd</b> except runs in foreground.<br><br><b>-bh</b><br><br>Print the persistent host status database.<br><br><b>-bH</b><br><br>Purge expired entries from the persistent host status database.<br><br><b>-bi</b><br><br>Initialize the alias database.<br><br><b>-bm</b><br><br>Deliver mail in the usual way (default).<br><br><b>-bp</b><br><br>Print a listing of the <b>queue</b>(s).<br><br><b>-bP</b><br><br>Print number of entries in the <b>queue</b>(s); only available with shared memory support.<br><br><b>-bs</b><br><br>Use the SMTP protocol as described in RFC821 on standard input and output. This flag implies all the operations of the <b>-ba</b> flag that are compatible
 with SMTP.<br><br><b>-bt</b><br><br>Run in address test mode. This mode reads addresses and shows the steps in parsing; it is used for debugging configuration tables.<br><br><b>-bv</b><br><br>Verify names only - do not try to collect or deliver a message. Verify mode is normally used for validating users or mailing lists.<br><br><b>-C</b>file<br><br>Use alternate configuration file. <b>Sendmail</b> gives up any enhanced (set-user-ID or set-group-ID) privileges if an alternate configuration file is
 specified.-D Send debugging output to the indicated log file instead of stdout.-dcategory.level...Set the debugging flag for category to level. Category is either an integer or a name specifying the topic, and level an integer
 specifying the level of debugging output desired. Higher levels generally mean more output. More than one flag can be specified by separating them with commas.
 A list of numeric debugging categories can be found in the TRACEFLAGS file in the sendmail source distribution.<br>
 The option <b>-d0.1</b> prints the version of <b>sendmail</b> and the options it was compiled with.<br>
 Most other categories are only useful with, and documented in, <b>sendmail</b>s source code.-FfullnameSet the full name of the sender.-fname<br><br>Sets the name of the from person (i.e., the envelope sender of the mail). This address may also be used in the From: header if that header is missing
 during initial submission. The envelope sender address is used as the recipient for delivery status notifications and may also appear in a Return-Path: header.
 <b>-f</b> should only be used by trusted users (normally root, daemon, and network) or if the person you are trying to become is the
 same as the person you are. Otherwise, an X-Authentication-Warning header will be added to the message.<br><br><b>-G</b><br><br>Relay (gateway) submission of a message, e.g., when <b>rmail</b> calls <b>sendmail .</b><br><br><b>-h</b>N<br><br>Set the hop count to N. The hop count is incremented every time the mail is processed. When it reaches a limit, the mail is returned with an error
 message, the victim of an aliasing loop. If not specified, Received: lines in the message are counted.<br><br><b>-i</b><br><br>Ignore dots alone on lines by themselves in incoming messages. This should be set if you are reading data from a file.<br><br><b>-L</b> tag<br><br>Set the identifier used in syslog messages to the supplied tag.<br><br><b>-N</b> dsn<br><br>Set delivery status notification conditions to dsn, which can be never for no notifications or a comma separated list of the values failure to be
 notified if delivery failed, delay to be notified if delivery is delayed, and success to be notified when the message is successfully delivered.<br><br><b>-n</b><br><br>Dont do aliasing.-O Set option option to the specified value. This form uses long names. See below for more details.-ox valueSet option x to the specified value. This form uses single character names only. The short names are not described in this manual page; see
 the Sendmail Installation and Operation Guide for details.-pprotocolSet the name of the protocol used to receive the message. This can be a simple protocol name such as UUCP or a protocol and hostname, such as
 UUCP:ucbvax.-q[Process saved messages in the queue at given intervals. If time is omitted, process the queue once. Time is given as a tagged number, with s
 being seconds, m being minutes (default), h being hours, d being days, and w being weeks. For example, -q1h30m or -q90m would both set the timeout
 to one hour thirty minutes. By default, <b>sendmail</b> will run in the background. This option can be used safely with <b>-bd</b>.-qp[Similar to <b>-q</b>time, except that instead of periodically forking a child to process the queue, sendmail forks a single persistent child for each
 queue that alternates between processing the queue and sleeping. The sleep time is given as the argument; it defaults to 1 second. The process will always
 sleep at least 5 seconds if the queue was empty in the previous queue run.-qf

 <br><br>Process saved messages in the queue once and do not fork(), but run in the foreground.-qGProcess jobs in queue group called name only.-q[Limit processed jobs to those containing substr as a substring of the queue id or not when ! is specified.-q[Limit processed jobs to quarantined jobs containing substr as a substring of the quarantine reason or not when ! is specified.-q[Limit processed jobs to those containing substr as a substring of one of the recipients or not when ! is specified.-q[Limit processed jobs to those containing substr as a substring of the sender or not when ! is specified.-Q[reason]
 Quarantine a normal queue items with the given reason or unquarantine quarantined queue items if no reason is given. This should only be used with some sort
 of item matching using as described above.-R Set the amount of the message to be returned if the message bounces. The return parameter can be full to return the entire message or hdrs to
 return only the headers. In the latter case also local bounces return only the headers.-rname<br><br>An alternate and obsolete form of the <b>-f</b> flag.<br><br><b>-t</b><br><br>Read message for recipients. To:, Cc:, and Bcc: lines will be scanned for recipient addresses. The Bcc: line will be deleted before transmission.-V Set the original envelope id. This is propagated across SMTP to servers that support DSNs and is returned in DSN-compliant error messages.-v

 <br><br>Go into verbose mode. Alias expansions will be announced, etc.-X Log all traffic in and out of mailers in the indicated log file. This should only be used as a last resort for debugging mailer bugs. It will log a lot of
 data very quickly.--

 <br><br>Stop processing command flags and use the rest of the arguments as addresses.

 <br><br><b>Options</b>
 -o flag (for short names), the -O flag (for long names), or in the configuration file. This is a partial list limited to
 those options that are likely to be useful on the command line and only shows the long names; for a complete list (and details), consult the Use alternate alias file.HoldExpensive
 On mailers that are considered expensive to connect to, dont initiate immediate connection. This requires queueing.CheckpointInterval=Checkpoint the queue file after every N successful deliveries (default 10). This avoids excessive duplicate deliveries when sending to long mailing
 lists interrupted by system crashes.DeliveryMode=Set the delivery mode to x. Delivery modes are i for interactive (synchronous) delivery, b for background (asynchronous) delivery, q for queue
 only - i.e., actual delivery is done the next time the queue is run, and d for deferred - the same as q except that database lookups for maps which have
 set the -D option (default for the host map) are avoided.ErrorMode=Set error processing to mode x. Valid modes are m to mail back the error message, w to write back the error message (or mail it back if the
 sender is not logged in), p to print the errors on the terminal (default), q to throw away error messages (only exit status is returned), and e to do
 special processing for the BerkNet. If the text of the message is not mailed back by modes m or w and if the sender is local to this machine, a copy of the
 message is appended to the file dead.letter in the senders home directory.SaveFromLine
 Save UNIX-style From lines at the front of messages.MaxHopCount=The maximum number of times a message is allowed to hop before we decide it is in a loop.IgnoreDots
 Do not take dots on a line by themselves as a message terminator.SendMimeErrors
 Send error messages in MIME format. If not set, the DSN (Delivery Status Notification) SMTP extension is disabled.ConnectionCacheTimeout=Set connection cache timeout.ConnectionCacheSize=Set connection cache size.LogLevel=The log level.MeToo=Dont send to me (the sender) if I am in an alias expansion.CheckAliases
 Validate the right hand side of aliases during a <b>newaliases</b>(1) command.OldStyleHeaders
 If set, this message may have old style headers. If not set, this message is guaranteed to have new style headers (i.e., commas instead of spaces between
 addresses). If set, an adaptive algorithm is used that will correctly determine the header format in most cases.QueueDirectory=Select the directory in which to queue messages.StatusFile=Save statistics in the named file.Timeout.queuereturn=Set the timeout on undelivered messages in the queue to the specified time. After delivery has failed (e.g., because of a host being down) for this amount
 of time, failed messages will be returned to the sender. The default is five days.UserDatabaseSpec=If set, a user database is consulted to get forwarding information. You can consider this an adjunct to the aliasing mechanism, except that the database is
 intended to be distributed; aliases are local to a particular host. This may not be available if your sendmail does not have the USERDB option compiled
 in.ForkEachJob
 Fork each job during queue runs. May be convenient on memory-poor machines.SevenBitInput
 Strip incoming messages to seven bits.EightBitMode=Set the handling of eight bit input to seven bit destinations to mode: m (mimefy) will convert to seven-bit MIME format, p (pass) will pass it as
 eight bits (but violates protocols), and s (strict) will bounce the message.MinQueueAge=Sets how long a job must ferment in the queue between attempts to send it.DefaultCharSet=Sets the default character set used to label 8-bit data that is not otherwise labelled.DialDelay=If opening a connection fails, sleep for sleeptime seconds and try again. Useful on dial-on-demand sites.NoRecipientAction=Set the behaviour when there are no recipient headers (To:, Cc: or Bcc:) in the message to action: none leaves the message unchanged, add-to adds a
 To: header with the envelope recipients, add-apparently-to adds an Apparently-To: header with the envelope recipients, add-bcc adds an empty Bcc: header, and
 add-to-undisclosed adds a header reading To: undisclosed-recipients:;.MaxDaemonChildren=Sets the maximum number of children that an incoming SMTP daemon will allow to spawn at any time to N.ConnectionRateThrottle=Sets the maximum number of connections per second to the SMTP port to N.In aliases, the first character of a name may be a vertical bar to cause interpretation of the rest of the name as a command to pipe the mail to. It may be
 necessary to quote the name to keep sendmail from suppressing the blanks from between arguments. For example, a common alias is:
 msgs: |/usr/bin/msgs -sAliases may also have the syntax :include:sendmail to read the named file for a list of recipients. For example, an alias
 such as:
 poets: :include:/usr/local/lib/poets.listwould read <br><br><b>Sendmail</b> returns an exit status describing what it did. The codes are defined in &lt;sysexits.h&gt;:EX_OK

 <br><br>Successful completion on all addresses.EX_NOUSER
 User name not recognized.EX_UNAVAILABLE
 Catchall meaning necessary resources were not available.EX_SYNTAX
 Syntax error in address.EX_SOFTWARE
 Internal software error, including bad arguments.EX_OSERR
 Temporary operating system error, such as cannot fork.EX_NOHOST
 Host name not recognized.EX_TEMPFAIL
 Message could not be sent immediately, but was queued.If invoked as newaliases, sendmail will rebuild the alias database. If invoked as mailq, sendmail will print the contents of the
 mail queue. If invoked as hoststat, sendmail will print the persistent host status database. If invoked as purgestat, sendmail will
 purge expired entries from the persistent host status database. If invoked as smtpd, sendmail will act as a daemon, as if the -bd option
 were specified.

 <br><br>Mailx is an intelligent mail processing system, which has a command syntax reminiscent of <b><a href=ed>ed</a></b>(1) with lines replaced by messages. It is based
 on Berkeley Mail 8.1, is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX <b>mailx</b> command, and offers extensions for MIME, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and S/MIME.
 Mailx provides enhanced features for interactive use, such as caching and disconnected operation for IMAP, message threading, scoring, and filtering. It
 is also usable as a mail batch language, both for sending and receiving mail.<br><br>The following options are accepted:
 -A Executes an account command (see below) for name after the startup files have been read.-a Attach the given file to the message.-B

 <br><br>Make standard input and standard output line-buffered.-b Send blind carbon copies to list. List should be a comma-separated list of names.-c Send carbon copies to list of users.-D

 All messages that satisfy the given IMAP-style SEARCH criterion. This addressing mode is available with all types of folders; for folders not located
 on IMAP servers, or for servers unable to execute the SEARCH command, mailx will perform the search locally. Strings must be enclosed by double quotes
  in their entirety if they contain white space or parentheses; within the quotes, only backslash \ is recognized as an escape character. All string
 searches are case-insensitive. When the description indicates that the envelope representation of an address field is used, this means that the search string
 is checked against both a list constructed as
 <b>(</b>real name<b> </b>source-route<b> </b>local-part<b> </b>domain-part<b>)

 </b>for each address, and the addresses without real names from the respective header field. Criteria can be nested using parentheses.(criterion1 criterion2)
 All messages that satisfy all of the given criteria.(or )
 All messages that satisfy either criterion1 or criterion2, or both. To connect more than two criteria using or, (or) specifications have to
 be nested using additional parentheses, as with (or a (or b c)); (or a b c) means ((a or b) and c). For a simple or operation of independent criteria on
 the lowest nesting level, it is possible to achieve similar effects by using three separate criteria, as with (a) (b) (c).(not )
 All messages that do not satisfy criterion.(bcc )
 All messages that contain string in the envelope representation of the Bcc: field.(cc )
 All messages that contain string in the envelope representation of the Cc: field.(from )
 All messages that contain string in the envelope representation of the From: field.(subject )
 All messages that contain string in the Subject: field.(to )
 All messages that contain string in the envelope representation of the To: field.(header )
 All messages that contain string in the specified Name: field.(body )
 All messages that contain string in their body.(text )
 All messages that contain string in their header or body.(larger )
 All messages that are larger than size (in bytes).(smaller )
 All messages that are smaller than size (in bytes).(before )
 All messages that were received before date; date must be in the form d[d]<b>-</b>mon<b>-</b>yyyy, where
 d[d] is the day of the month as one or two digits, mon is the name of the month-one of Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul,
 Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, or Dec, and yyyy is the year as four digits; e.g. 30-Aug-2004.(on )
 All messages that were received on the specified date.(since )
 All messages that were received since the specified date.(sentbefore )
 All messages that were sent on the specified date.(senton )
 All messages that were sent on the specified date.(sentsince )
 All messages that were sent since the specified date.()

 <br><br>The same criterion as for the previous search. This specification cannot be used as part of another criterion. If the previous command line contained more
 than one independent criterion, the last of those criteria is used.A practical method to read a set of messages is to issue a  repeatedly.

 <br><br><b>Ending a mail processing session</b>
 <br><br><b>Personal and systemwide distribution lists</b>
 alias aliases(5) and sendmail(8); these are kept in a different syntax. In mail the user
 sends, personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent to others so that they will be able to reply to the recipients. System wide aliases are not expanded when
 the mail is sent, but any reply returned to the machine will have the system wide alias expanded as all mail goes through sendmail.
 <br><br><b>Recipient address specifications</b>
 | character specifies a pipe, the command string following the
 | is executed and the message is sent to its standard input; any other name which contains a @ character is treated as a mail address; any other
 name which starts with a + character specifies a folder name; any other name which contains a / character but no ! or %
 character before also specifies a folder name; what remains is treated as a mail address. Compressed folders are handled as described for the <br><br><b>Network mail (Internet / ARPA, UUCP, Berknet)</b>
 <a href=/man/7/mailaddr rel=nofollow>mailaddr</a>(7) for a description of network addresses. <br><br><b>MIME types</b>
 /subtype      extension<br><br><b>Character sets</b>
 <br><br>The character set for outgoing messages is not necessarily the same as the one used on the terminal. If an outgoing text message contains characters not
 representable in US-ASCII, the character set being used must be declared within its header. Permissible values can be declared using the sendcharsets
 variable, separated by commas; mailx tries each of the values in order and uses the first appropriate one. If the message contains characters that
 cannot be represented in any of the given character sets, the message will not be sent, and its text will be saved to the dead.letter file. Messages that
 contain NUL bytes are not converted.<br><br>Outgoing attachments are converted if they are plain text. If the sendcharsets variable contains more than one character set name, the ~@
 tilde escape will ask for the character sets for individual attachments if it is invoked without arguments.<br><br>Best results are usually achieved when mailx is run in a UTF-8 locale on a UTF-8 capable terminal. In this setup, characters from various countries
 can be displayed, while it is still possible to use more simple character sets for sending to retain maximum compatibility with older mail clients.

 <br><br><b>Commands</b>
 <br><br>The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the following methods:• An argument can be enclosed between paired double-quotes  or single-quotes ; any white space, shell word expansion, or backslash characters within the
 quotes are treated literally as part of the argument. A double-quote will be treated literally within single-quotes and vice versa. These special properties of
 the quote marks occur only when they are paired at the beginning and end of the argument.

 <br><br>• A backslash outside of the enclosing quotes is discarded and the following character is treated literally as part of the argument.<br><br>• An unquoted backslash at the end of a command line is discarded and the next line continues the command.Filenames, where expected, are subjected to the following transformations, in sequence:
 <br><br>• Shell word expansions are applied to the filename. If more than a single pathname results from this expansion and the command is expecting one file, an
 error results.The following commands are provided:
 -

 <br><br>Print out the preceding message. If given a numeric argument n, goes to the nth previous message and prints it.<br><br><b>?</b><br><br>Prints a brief summary of commands.<br><br><b>!</b><br><br>Executes the shell (see <b><a href=sh>sh</a></b>(1) and <b><a href=csh>csh</a></b>(1)) command which follows.<br><br><b>|</b><br><br>A synonym for the pipe command.account
 (ac) Creates, selects or lists an email account. An account is formed by a group of commands, primarily of those to set variables. With two arguments, of
 which the second is a {, the first argument gives an account name, and the following lines create a group of commands for that account until a line
 containing a single } appears. With one argument, the previously created group of commands for the account name is executed, and a folder command is
 executed for the system mailbox or inbox of that account. Without arguments, the list of accounts and their contents are printed. As an example,

 <b>    account</b> myisp <b>{
 </b>        set folder=imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example
         set record=+Sent
         set from=myname@myisp.example (My Name)
         set smtp=smtp.myisp.example
 <b>    }
 </b>creates an account named myisp which can later be selected by specifying account myisp.alias

 <br><br>(a) With no arguments, prints out all currently-defined aliases. With one argument, prints out that alias. With more than one argument, creates a new alias
 or changes an old one.alternates
 (alt) The alternates command is useful if the user has accounts on several machines. It can be used to inform mailx that the listed addresses all
 belong to the invoking user. When he replies to messages, mailx will not send a copy of the message to any of the addresses listed on the alternates
 list. If the alternates command is given with no argument, the current set of alternate names is displayed.answered
 (ans) Takes a message list and marks each message as a having been answered. This mark has no technical meaning in the mail system; it just causes messages
 to be marked in the header summary, and makes them specially addressable.cache

 <br><br>Only applicable to cached IMAP mailboxes; takes a message list and reads the specified messages into the IMAP cache.<br><br><b>call</b><br><br>Calls a macro (see the define command).<br><br><b>cd</b><br><br>Same as chdir.certsave
 Only applicable to S/MIME signed messages. Takes a message list and a file name and saves the certificates contained within the message signatures to the
 named file in both human-readable and PEM format. The certificates can later be used to send encrypted messages to the messages originators by setting the
 smime-encrypt-user@host variable.chdir

 <br><br>(ch) Changes the users working directory to that specified, if given. If no directory is given, then changes to the users login directory.classify
 (cl) Takes a list of messages and examines their contents for characteristics of junk mail using Bayesian filtering. Messages considered to be junk are then
 marked as such. The junk mail database is not changed.collapse
 (coll) Only applicable to threaded mode. Takes a message list and makes all replies to these messages invisible in header summaries, unless they are in
 state new.connect
 (conn) If operating in disconnected mode on an IMAP mailbox, switch to online mode and connect to the mail server while retaining the mailbox status. See
 the description of the disconnected variable for more information.copy

 <br><br>(c) The copy command does the same thing that save does, except that it does not mark the messages it is used on for deletion when the user quits.
 Compressed files and IMAP mailboxes are handled as described for the folder command.<br><br><b>Copy</b><br><br>(C) Similar to copy, but saves the messages in a file named after the local part of the sender address of the first message.decrypt
 (dec) For unencrypted messages, this command is identical to copy. Encrypted messages are first decrypted, if possible, and then copied.Decrypt
 (Dec) Similar to decrypt, but saves the messages in a file named after the local part of the sender address of the first message.define

 <br><br>(def) Defines a macro. A macro definition is a sequence of commands in the following form:<b>define</b> name <b>{</b><br>
 command1<br>
 command2<br>
 ...<br>
 commandN<b><br>
 }</b>
 <p>Once defined, a macro can be explicitly invoked using the call command, or can be implicitly invoked by setting the folder-hook or
 folder-hook-fullname variables.
 </p>defines
 Prints the currently defined macros including their contents.delete

 <br><br>(d) Takes a list of messages as argument and marks them all as deleted. Deleted messages will not be saved in mbox, nor will they be available for most
 other commands.discard
 Same as ignore.disconnect
 (disco) If operating in online mode on an IMAP mailbox, switch to disconnected mode while retaining the mailbox status. See the description of the
 disconnected variable for more information. A list of messages may optionally be given as argument; the respective messages are then read into the cache
 before the connection is closed. Thus disco * makes the entire current mailbox available for disconnected use.dp or dt
 Deletes the current message and prints the next message. If there is no next message, mailx says at EOF.draft

 <br><br>Takes a message list and marks each message as a draft. This mark has no technical meaning in the mail system; it just causes messages to be marked in the
 header summary, and makes them specially addressable.<br><br><b>echo</b><br><br>Echoes its arguments, resolving special names as documented for the folder command. The escape sequences <b>\a</b>, <b>\b</b>, <b>\c</b>, <b>\f</b>,
 <b>\n</b>, <b>\r</b>, <b>\t</b>, <b>\v</b>, <b>\\</b>, and <b>\0</b>num are interpreted as with the <b><a href=echo>echo</a></b>(1) command.<br><br><b>edit</b><br><br>(e) Takes a list of messages and points the text editor at each one in turn. Modified contents are discarded unless the writebackedited variable is
 set.<br><br><b>else</b><br><br>Marks the end of the then-part of an if statement and the beginning of the part to take effect if the condition of the if statement is false.<br><br><b>endif</b><br><br>Marks the end of an if statement.<br><br><b>exit</b><br><br>(ex or x) Effects an immediate return to the Shell without modifying the users system mailbox, his mbox file, or his edit file in -f.<br><br><b>file</b><br><br>(fi) The same as folder.<br><br><b>flag</b><br><br>(fl) Takes a message list and marks the messages as flagged for urgent/special attention. This mark has no technical meaning in the mail system; it just
 causes messages to be highlighted in the header summary, and makes them specially addressable.folders
 With no arguments, list the names of the folders in the folder directory. With an existing folder as an argument, lists then names of folders below the
 named folder; e.g. the command folders @ lists the folders on the base level of the current IMAP server. See also the imap-list-depth
 variable.folder

 <br><br>(fold) The folder command switches to a new mail file or folder. With no arguments, it tells the user which file he is currently reading. If an argument is
 given, it will write out changes (such as deletions) the user has made in the current file and read in the new file. Some special conventions are recognized
 for the name. <b>#</b> means the previous file, <b>%</b> means the invoking users system mailbox, <b>%</b>user means users system mailbox,
 <b>&amp;</b> means the invoking users mbox file, and <b>+</b>file means a file in the folder directory. <b>%:</b>filespec expands to the same
 value as filespec, but the file is handled as a system mailbox e. g. by the mbox and save commands. If the name matches one of the strings defined with
 the shortcut command, it is replaced by its long form and expanded. If the name ends with <b>.gz</b> or <b>.bz2</b>, it is treated as compressed with
 <b><a href=gzip>gzip</a></b>(1) or <b><a href=bzip2>bzip2</a></b>(1), respectively. Likewise, if name does not exist, but either name<b>.gz</b> or name<b>.bz2</b> exists,
 the compressed file is used. If name refers to a directory with the subdirectories tmp, new, and cur, it is treated as a folder in maildir
 format. A name of the formprotocol<b>://</b>[user<b>@</b>]host[<b>:</b>port][<b>/</b>file]
 <p>is taken as an Internet mailbox specification. The supported protocols are currently <b>imap</b> (IMAP v4r1), <b>imaps</b> (IMAP with SSL/TLS encryption),
 <b>pop3</b> (POP3), and <b>pop3s</b> (POP3 with SSL/TLS encryption). If user contains special characters, in particular / or %, they must be escaped
 in URL notation, as %2F or %25. The optional file part applies to IMAP only; if it is omitted, the default INBOX is used. If mailx is
 connected to an IMAP server, a name of the form <b>@</b>mailbox refers to the mailbox on that server. If the folder variable refers to an IMAP
 account, the special name % selects the INBOX on that account.
 </p>Followup
 (F) Similar to Respond, but saves the message in a file named after the local part of the first recipients address.followup
 (fo) Similar to respond, but saves the message in a file named after the local part of the first recipients address.followupall
 Similar to followup, but responds to all recipients regardless of the flipr and Replyall variables.followupsender
 Similar to Followup, but responds to the sender only regardless of the flipr and Replyall variables.forward
 (fwd) Takes a message and the address of a recipient and forwards the message to him. The text of the original message is included in the new one, with the
 value of the fwdheading variable printed before. The fwdignore and fwdretain commands specify which header fields are included in the new
 message. Only the first part of a multipart message is included unless the forward-as-attachment option is set.Forward
 (Fwd) Similar to forward, but saves the message in a file named after the local part of the recipients address.from

 <br><br>(f) Takes a list of messages and prints their message headers, piped through the pager if the output does not fit on the screen.fwdignore
 Specifies which header fields are to be ignored with the forward command. This command has no effect when the forward-as-attachment option is
 set.fwdretain
 Specifies which header fields are to be retained with the forward command. fwdretain overrides fwdignore. This command has no effect
 when the forward-as-attachment option is set.good

 <br><br>(go) Takes a list of messages and marks all of them as not being junk mail. Data from these messages is then inserted into the junk mail database for future
 classification.headers
 (h) Lists the current range of headers, which is an 18-message group. If a + argument is given, then the next 18-message group is printed, and if a -
 argument is given, the previous 18-message group is printed.help

 <br><br>A synonym for ?.<br><br><b>hold</b><br><br>(ho, also preserve) Takes a message list and marks each message therein to be saved in the users system mailbox instead of in mbox. Does not override the
 delete command. mailx deviates from the POSIX standard with this command, as a next command issued after hold will display the following message,
 not the current one.<br><br><b>if</b><br><br>Commands in mailxs startup files can be executed conditionally depending on whether the user is sending or receiving mail with the if command. For
 example:<b>if</b> receive<br>
 commands . . .<b><br>
 endif</b>
 <p>An else form is also available:
 </p><b>        if</b> receive
                 commands . . .
 <b>        else
 </b>                commands . . .
 <b>        endif

 </b>Note that the only allowed conditions are <b>receive</b>, <b>send</b>, and <b>term</b> (execute command if standard input is a tty).ignore

 <br><br>Add the list of header fields named to the ignored list. Header fields in the ignore list are not printed on the terminal when a message is printed. This
 command is very handy for suppression of certain machine-generated header fields. The Type and Print commands can be used to print a message in its entirety,
 including ignored fields. If ignore is executed with no arguments, it lists the current set of ignored fields.<br><br><b>imap</b><br><br>Sends command strings directly to the current IMAP server. Mailx operates always in IMAP selected state on the current mailbox; commands that
 change this will produce undesirable results and should be avoided. Useful IMAP commands are:
 <br><br><b>create</b><br><br>Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an argument and creates it.
 <b>getquotaroot</b>

 <br><br>Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an argument and prints the quotas that apply to the mailbox. Not all IMAP servers support this command.
 <b>namespace</b>

 <br><br>Takes no arguments and prints the Personal Namespaces, the Other Users Namespaces, and the Shared Namespaces. Each namespace type is printed in
 parentheses; if there are multiple namespaces of the same type, inner parentheses separate them. For each namespace, a namespace prefix and a hierarchy
 separator is listed. Not all IMAP servers support this command.
 inc

 <br><br>Same as newmail.<br><br><b>junk</b><br><br>(j) Takes a list of messages and marks all of them as junk mail. Data from these messages is then inserted into the junk mail database for future
 classification.<br><br><b>kill</b><br><br>(k) Takes a list of messages and kills them. Killed messages are not printed in header summaries, and are ignored by the next command. The
 kill command also sets the score of the messages to negative infinity, so that subsequent score commands will not unkill them again. Killing is
 only effective for the current session on a folder; when it is quit, all messages are automatically unkilled.<br><br><b>list</b><br><br>Prints the names of all available commands.<br><br><b>Mail</b><br><br>(M) Similar to mail, but saves the message in a file named after the local part of the first recipients address.<br><br><b>mail</b><br><br>(m) Takes as argument login names and distribution group names and sends mail to those people.<br><br><b>mbox</b><br><br>Indicate that a list of messages be sent to mbox in the users home directory when mailx is quit. This is the default action for messages if unless
 the hold option is set. mailx deviates from the POSIX standard with this command, as a next command issued after mbox will display the
 following message, not the current one.<br><br><b>move</b><br><br>(mv) Acts like copy, but marks the messages for deletion if they were transferred successfully.<br><br><b>Move</b><br><br>(Mv) Similar to move, but moves the messages to a file named after the local part of the sender address of the first message.newmail
 Checks for new mail in the current folder without committing any changes before. If new mail is present, a message is printed. If the header variable
 is set, the headers of each new message are also printed.next

 <br><br>(n) like + or CR) Goes to the next message in sequence and types it. With an argument list, types the next matching message.<br><br><b>New</b><br><br>Same as unread.<br><br><b>new</b><br><br>Same as unread.<br><br><b>online</b><br><br>Same as connect.<br><br><b>noop</b><br><br>If the current folder is located on an IMAP or POP3 server, a NOOP command is sent. Otherwise, no operation is performed.<br><br><b>Pipe</b><br><br>(Pi) Like pipe but also pipes ignored header fields and all parts of MIME multipart/alternative messages.<br><br><b>pipe</b><br><br>(pi) Takes a message list and a shell command and pipes the messages through the command. Without an argument, the current message is piped through the
 command given by the cmd variable. If the page variable is set, every message is followed by a formfeed character.preserve
 (pre) A synonym for hold.Print

 <br><br>(P) Like print but also prints out ignored header fields and all parts of MIME multipart/alternative messages. See also print,
 ignore, and retain.<br><br><b>print</b><br><br>(p) Takes a message list and types out each message on the users terminal. If the message is a MIME multipart message, all parts with a content type of
 text or message are shown, the other are hidden except for their headers. Messages are decrypted and converted to the terminal character set if
 necessary.probability
 (prob) For each word given as argument, the contents of its junk mail database entry are printed.quit

 <br><br>(q) Terminates the session, saving all undeleted, unsaved messages in the users mbox file in his login directory, preserving all messages marked with hold
 or preserve or never referenced in his system mailbox, and removing all other messages from his system mailbox. If new mail has arrived during the session, the
 message You have new mail is given. If given while editing a mailbox file with the -f flag, then the edit file is rewritten. A return to the Shell is
 effected, unless the rewrite of edit file fails, in which case the user can escape with the exit command.redirect
 (red) Same as resend.Redirect
 (Red) Same as Resend.remove

 <br><br>(rem) Removes the named folders. The user is asked for confirmation in interactive mode.<br><br><b>rename</b><br><br>(ren) Takes the name of an existing folder and the name for the new folder and renames the first to the second one. Both folders must be of the same type
 and must be located on the current server for IMAP.<br><br><b>Reply</b><br><br>(R) Reply to originator. Does not reply to other recipients of the original message.<br><br><b>reply</b><br><br>(r) Takes a message list and sends mail to the sender and all recipients of the specified message. The default message must not be deleted.replyall
 Similar to reply, but responds to all recipients regardless of the flipr and Replyall variables.replysender
 Similar to Reply, but responds to the sender only regardless of the flipr and Replyall variables.Resend

 <br><br>Like resend, but does not add any header lines. This is not a way to hide the senders identity, but useful for sending a message again to the same
 recipients.<br><br><b>resend</b><br><br>Takes a list of messages and a user name and sends each message to the named user. Resent-From: and related header fields are prepended to the new copy of
 the message.Respond
 Same as Reply.respond
 Same as reply.respondall
 Same as replyall.respondsender
 Same as replysender.retain

 <br><br>Add the list of header fields named to the retained list. Only the header fields in the retain list are shown on the terminal when a message is printed. All
 other header fields are suppressed. The Type and Print commands can be used to print a message in its entirety. If retain is executed with no arguments, it
 lists the current set of retained fields.<br><br><b>Save</b><br><br>(S) Similar to save, but saves the messages in a file named after the local part of the sender of the first message instead of taking a filename
 argument.<br><br><b>save</b><br><br>(s) Takes a message list and a filename and appends each message in turn to the end of the file. If no filename is given, the mbox file is used. The
 filename in quotes, followed by the line count and character count is echoed on the users terminal. If editing a system mailbox, the messages are marked for
 deletion. Compressed files and IMAP mailboxes are handled as described for the -f command line option above.savediscard
 Same as saveignore.saveignore
 Saveignore is to save what ignore is to print and type. Header fields thus marked are filtered out when saving a message by save or when automatically
 saving to mbox. This command should only be applied to header fields that do not contain information needed to decode the message, as MIME content fields do.
 If saving messages on an IMAP account, ignoring fields makes it impossible to copy the data directly on the server, thus operation usually becomes much
 slower.saveretain
 Saveretain is to save what retain is to print and type. Header fields thus marked are the only ones saved with a message when saving by save or when
 automatically saving to mbox. Saveretain overrides saveignore. The use of this command is strongly discouraged since it may strip header fields that are needed
 to decode the message correctly.score

 <br><br>(sc) Takes a message list and a floating point number and adds the number to the score of each given message. All messages start at score 0 when a folder is
 opened. When the score of a message becomes negative, it is killed with the effects described for the kill command; otherwise if it was negative
 before and becomes positive, it is unkilled. Scores only refer to the currently opened instance of a folder.<br><br><b>set</b><br><br>(se) With no arguments, prints all variable values, piped through the pager if the output does not fit on the screen. Otherwise, sets option. Arguments are
 of the form option=value (no space before or after =) or option. Quotation marks may be placed around any part of the assignment statement to quote blanks or
 tabs, i.e. set indentprefix=-&gt;. If an argument begins with <b>no</b>, as in <b>set no</b>save, the effect is the same as invoking the
 unset command with the remaining part of the variable (unset save).<br><br><b>seen</b><br><br>Takes a message list and marks all messages as having been read.<br><br><b>shell</b><br><br>(sh) Invokes an interactive version of the shell.shortcut
 Defines a shortcut name and its string for expansion, as described for the folder command. With no arguments, a list of defined shortcuts is
 printed.show

 <br><br>(Sh) Like print, but performs neither MIME decoding nor decryption so that the raw message text is shown.<br><br><b>size</b><br><br>Takes a message list and prints out the size in characters of each message.<br><br><b>sort</b><br><br>Create a sorted representation of the current folder, and change the next command and the addressing modes such that they refer to messages in the
 sorted order. Message numbers are the same as in regular mode. If the header variable is set, a header summary in the new order is also printed.
 Possible sorting criteria are:<b>date</b>

 <p>Sort the messages by their Date: field, that is by the time they were sent.

 </p><p><b>from</b>

 </p><p>Sort messages by the value of their From: field, that is by the address of the sender. If the showname variable is set, the senders real name (if
 any) is used.

 </p><p><b>size</b>

 </p><p>Sort the messages by their size.

 </p><p><b>score</b>

 </p><p>Sort the messages by their score.

 </p><p><b>status</b>

 </p><p>Sort the messages by their message status (new, read, old, etc.).
 </p><b>subject</b>

 <br><br>Sort the messages by their subject.
 <b>thread</b>

 <p>Create a threaded order, as with the thread command.

 </p><p><b>to</b>

 </p><p>Sort messages by the value of their To: field, that is by the address of the recipient. If the showname variable is set, the recipients real name
 (if any) is used.
 </p>If no argument is given, the current sorting criterion is printed.source

 <br><br>The source command reads commands from a file.<br><br><b>thread</b><br><br>(th) Create a threaded representation of the current folder, i.e. indent messages that are replies to other messages in the header display, and change the
 next command and the addressing modes such that they refer to messages in the threaded order. Message numbers are the same as in unthreaded mode. If the
 header variable is set, a header summary in threaded order is also printed.<br><br><b>top</b><br><br>Takes a message list and prints the top few lines of each. The number of lines printed is controlled by the variable toplines and defaults to five.<br><br><b>touch</b><br><br>Takes a message list and marks the messages for saving in the mbox file. mailx deviates from the POSIX standard with this command, as a next
 command issued after mbox will display the following message, not the current one.<br><br><b>Type</b><br><br>(T) Identical to the Print command.<br><br><b>type</b><br><br>(t) A synonym for print.unalias
 Takes a list of names defined by alias commands and discards the remembered groups of users. The group names no longer have any significance.unanswered
 Takes a message list and marks each message as not having been answered.uncollapse
 (unc) Only applicable to threaded mode. Takes a message list and makes the message and all replies to it visible in header summaries again. When a message
 becomes the current message, it is automatically made visible. Also when a message with collapsed replies is printed, all of these are automatically
 uncollapsed.undef

 <br><br>Undefines each of the named macros. It is not an error to use a name that does not belong to one of the currently defined macros.undelete
 (u) Takes a message list and marks each message as not being deleted.undraft
 Takes a message list and marks each message as a draft.unflag

 <br><br>Takes a message list and marks each message as not being flagged.unfwdignore
 Removes the header field names from the list of ignored fields for the forward command.unfwdretain
 Removes the header field names from the list of retained fields for the forward command.ungood

 <br><br>Takes a message list and undoes the effect of a good command that was previously applied on exactly these messages.unignore
 Removes the header field names from the list of ignored fields.unjunk

 <br><br>Takes a message list and undoes the effect of a junk command that was previously applied on exactly these messages.<br><br><b>unkill</b><br><br>Takes a message list and unkills each message. Also sets the score of the messages to 0.<br><br><b>Unread</b><br><br>Same as unread.<br><br><b>unread</b><br><br>(U) Takes a message list and marks each message as not having been read.unretain
 Removes the header field names from the list of retained fields.unsaveignore
 Removes the header field names from the list of ignored fields for saving.unsaveretain
 Removes the header field names from the list of retained fields for saving.unset

 <br><br>Takes a list of option names and discards their remembered values; the inverse of set.unshortcut
 Deletes the shortcut names given as arguments.unsort

 <br><br>Disable sorted or threaded mode (see the sort and thread commands), return to normal message order and, if the header variable is set,
 print a header summary.unthread
 (unth) Same as unsort.verify

 <br><br>(verif) Takes a message list and verifies each message. If a message is not an S/MIME signed message, verification will fail for it. The verification
 process checks if the message was signed using a valid certificate, if the message senders email address matches one of those contained within the
 certificate, and if the message content has been altered.<br><br><b>visual</b><br><br>(v) Takes a message list and invokes the display editor on each message. Modified contents are discarded unless the writebackedited variable is set.<br><br><b>write</b><br><br>(w) For conventional messages, the body without all headers is written. The output is decrypted and converted to its native format, if necessary. If the
 output file exists, the text is appended.-If a message is in MIME multipart format, its first part is written to the specified file as for conventional
 messages, and the user is asked for a filename to save each other part; if the contents of the first part are not to be saved, write /dev/null can be used.
 For the second and subsequent parts, if the filename given starts with a | character, the part is piped through the remainder of the filename interpreted as
 a shell command. In non-interactive mode, only the parts of the multipart message that have a filename given in the part header are written, the other are
 discarded. The original message is never marked for deletion in the originating mail folder. For attachments, the contents of the destination file are
 overwritten if the file previously existed. No special handling of compressed files is performed.<br><br><b>xit</b><br><br>(x) A synonym for exit.<br><br><b>z</b><br><br>Mailx presents message headers in windowfuls as described under the headers command. The z command scrolls to the next window of messages. If an
 argument is given, it specifies the window to use. A number prefixed by + or - indicates that the window is calculated in relation to the current position.
 A number without a prefix specifies an absolute window number, and a $ lets mailx scroll to the last window of messages.<br><br><b>Z</b><br><br>Similar to z, but scrolls to the next or previous window that contains at least one new or flagged message.

 <br><br><b>Tilde escapes</b>
 ~!commandExecute the indicated shell command, then return to the message.~.

 <br><br>Same effect as typing the end-of-file character.~&lt;filenameIdentical to ~r.~&lt;!commandCommand is executed using the shell. Its standard output is inserted into the message.~@ [With no arguments, edit the attachment list. First, the user can edit all existing attachment data. If an attachments file name is left empty, that
 attachment is deleted from the list. When the end of the attachment list is reached, mailx will ask for further attachments, until an empty file name is
 given. If filename arguments are specified, all of them are appended to the end of the attachment list. Filenames which contain white space can only be
 specified with the first method (no filename arguments).~A

 <br><br>Inserts the string contained in the Sign variable (same as ~i Sign). The escape sequences <b>\t</b> (tabulator) and <b>\n</b> (newline) are

 these fields originate from the from, replyto, and ORGANIZATION variables. If this tilde command has been used, changing the variables has
 no effect on the current message anymore.~ivariableInsert the value of the specified variable into the message adding a newline character at the end. If the variable is unset or empty, the message remains
 unaltered. The escape sequences <b>\t</b> (tabulator) and <b>\n</b> (newline) are understood.~mmessagesRead the named messages into the message being sent, indented by a tab or by the value of indentprefix. If no messages are specified, read the current
 message. Message headers currently being ignored (by the ignore or retain command) are not included. For MIME multipart messages, only the first printable part
 is included.~MmessagesIdentical to ~m, except all message headers and all MIME parts are included.~p

 <br><br>Print out the message collected so far, prefaced by the message header fields and followed by the attachment list, if any. If the message text is longer

 <br><br><b>Variable options</b>
 <br><br><b>Binary options</b>
 allnet

 <br><br>Causes only the local part to be evaluated when comparing addresses.<br><br><b>append</b><br><br>Causes messages saved in mbox to be appended to the end rather than prepended. This should always be set.ask or asksub
 Causes mailx to prompt for the subject of each message sent. If the user responds with simply a newline, no subject field will be sent.askatend
 Causes the prompts for Cc: and Bcc: lists to appear after the message has been edited.askattach
 If set, mailx asks for files to attach at the end of each message. Responding with a newline indicates not to include an attachment.askcc

 <br><br>Causes the user to be prompted for additional carbon copy recipients (at the end of each message if askatend or bsdcompat is set). Responding
 with a newline indicates the users satisfaction with the current list.<br><br><b>askbcc</b><br><br>Causes the user to be prompted for additional blind carbon copy recipients (at the end of each message if askatend or bsdcompat is set).
 Responding with a newline indicates the users satisfaction with the current list.asksign
 Causes the user to be prompted if the message is to be signed at the end of each message. The smime-sign variable is ignored when this variable is
 set.autocollapse
 Causes threads to be collapsed automatically when threaded mode is entered (see the collapse command).autoinc
 Same as newmail.autoprint
 Causes the delete command to behave like dp - thus, after deleting a message, the next one will be typed automatically.autothread
 Causes threaded mode (see the thread command) to be entered automatically when a folder is opened.bang

 <br><br>Enables the substitution of <b>!</b> by the contents of the last command line in shell escapes.bsdannounce
 Causes automatic display of a header summary after executing a folder command.bsdcompat
 Sets some cosmetical features to traditional BSD style; has the same affect as setting askatend and all other variables prefixed with bsd, setting
 prompt to &amp; , and changing the default pager to more.bsdflags
 Changes the letters printed in the first column of a header summary to traditional BSD style.bsdheadline
 Changes the display of columns in a header summary to traditional BSD style.bsdmsgs
 Changes some informational messages to traditional BSD style.bsdorder
 Causes the Subject: field to appear immediately after the To: field in message headers and with the ~h tilde command.bsdset

 <br><br>Changes the output format of the set command to traditional BSD style.chained-junk-tokens
 Normally, the Bayesian junk mail filter bases its classifications on single word tokens extracted from messages. If this option is set, adjacent words are
 combined to pairs, which are then used as additional tokens. This usually improves the accuracy of the filter, but also increases the junk mail database five-
 to tenfold.datefield
 The date in a header summary is normally the date of the mailbox From  line of the message. If this variable is set, the date as given in the Date:
 header field is used, converted to local time.debug

 <br><br>Prints debugging messages and disables the actual delivery of messages. Unlike verbose, this option is intended for mailx development
 only.disconnected
 When an IMAP mailbox is selected and this variable is set, no connection to the server is initiated. Instead, data is obtained from the local cache (see
 imap-cache). Mailboxes that are not present in the cache and messages that have not yet entirely been fetched from the server are not available; to
 fetch all messages in a mailbox at once, the command copy * /dev/null can be used while still in online mode. Changes that are made to IMAP mailboxes
 in disconnected mode are queued and committed later when a connection to that server is opened in online mode. This procedure is not completely reliable since
 it cannot be guaranteed that the IMAP unique identifiers (UIDs) on the server still match the ones in the cache at that time. Data is saved to dead.letter
 when this problem occurs.disconnected-user@hostThe specified account is handled as described for the disconnected variable above, but other accounts are not affected.dot

 <br><br>The binary option dot causes mailx to interpret a period alone on a line as the terminator of a message the user is sending.editheaders
 When a message is edited while being composed, its header is included in the editable text. To:, Cc:, Bcc:, Subject:, From:, Reply-To:,
 Sender:, and Organization: fields are accepted within the header, other fields are ignored.emptybox
 If set, an empty mailbox file is not removed. This may improve the interoperability with other mail user agents when using a common folder
 directory.emptystart
 If the mailbox is empty, mailx normally prints No mail for user and exits immediately. If this option is set, mailx starts even with
 an empty mailbox.flipr

 <br><br>Exchanges the Respond with the respond commands and vice-versa.forward-as-attachment
 Original messages are normally sent as inline text with the forward command, and only the first part of a multipart message is included. With this
 option, messages are sent as MIME message/rfc822 attachments, and all of their parts are included. The fwdignore and fwdretain options are
 ignored when the forward-as-attachment option is set.fullnames
 When replying to a message, mailx normally removes the comment parts of email addresses, which by convention contain the full names of the
 recipients. If this variable is set, such stripping is not performed, and comments are retained.header

 <br><br>Causes the header summary to be written at startup and after commands that affect the number of messages or the order of messages in the current folder;
 enabled by default.<br><br><b>hold</b><br><br>This option is used to hold messages in the system mailbox by default.<br><br><b>ignore</b><br><br>Causes interrupt signals from the terminal to be ignored and echoed as @s.ignoreeof
 An option related to dot is ignoreeof which makes mailx refuse to accept a control-d as the end of a message. Ignoreeof also applies to mailx
 command mode.imap-use-starttls
 Causes mailx to issue a STARTTLS command to make an unencrypted IMAP session SSL/TLS encrypted. This functionality is not supported by all servers,
 and is not used if the session is already encrypted by the IMAPS method.imap-use-starttls-user@hostActivates imap-use-starttls for a specific account.keep

 <br><br>This option causes mailx to truncate the users system mailbox instead of deleting it when it is empty. This should always be set, since it prevents
 malicious users from creating fake mail folders in a world-writable spool directory.keepsave
 When a message is saved, it is usually discarded from the originating folder when mailx is quit. Setting this option causes all saved message to be
 retained.markanswered
 When a message is replied to and this variable is set, it is marked as having been answered. This mark has no technical meaning in the mail system; it just
 causes messages to be marked in the header summary, and makes them specially addressable.metoo

 <br><br>Usually, when a group is expanded that contains the sender, the sender is removed from the expansion. Setting this option causes the sender to be included
 in the group.newmail
 Checks for new mail in the current folder each time the prompt is printed. For IMAP mailboxes, the server is then polled for new mail, which may result in
 delayed operation if the connection to the server is slow. A maildir folder must be re-scanned to determine if new mail has arrived.If this variable is set to the special value <b>nopoll</b>, an IMAP server is not actively asked for new mail, but new mail may still be detected and
 announced with any other IMAP command that is sent to the server. A maildir folder is not scanned then.
 <p>In any case, the IMAP server may send notifications about messages that have been deleted on the server by another process or client. In this case,
 Expunged n messages is printed regardless of this variable, and message numbers may have changed.
 </p>noheader
 Setting the option noheader is the same as giving the -N flag on the command line.outfolder
 Causes the filename given in the record variable and the sender-based filenames for the Copy and Save commands to be interpreted
 relative to the directory given in the folder variable rather than to the current directory unless it is an absolute pathname.page

 <br><br>If set, each message the pipe command prints out is followed by a formfeed character.piperaw
 Send messages to the pipe command without performing MIME and character set conversions.pop3-use-apop
 If this variable is set, the APOP authentication method is used when a connection to a POP3 server is initiated. The advantage of this method over the usual
 USER/PASS authentication is that the password is not sent over the network in clear text. The connection fails if the server does not support the APOP
 command.pop3-use-apop-user@hostEnables pop3-use-apop for a specific account.pop3-use-starttls
 Causes mailx to issue a STLS command to make an unencrypted POP3 session SSL/TLS encrypted. This functionality is not supported by all servers, and
 is not used if the session is already encrypted by the POP3S method.pop3-use-starttls-user@hostActivates pop3-use-starttls for a specific account.print-all-chars
 This option causes all characters to be considered printable. It is only effective if given in a startup file. With this option set, some character
 sequences in messages may put the users terminal in an undefined state when printed; it should only be used as a last resort if no working system locale can
 be found.print-alternatives
 When a MIME message part of type multipart/alternative is displayed and it contains a subpart of type text/plain, other parts are normally
 discarded. Setting this variable causes all subparts to be displayed, just as if the surrounding part was of type multipart/mixed.quiet

 <br><br>Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.record-resent
 If both this variable and the record variable are set, the resend and Resend commands save messages to the record folder as it
 is normally only done for newly composed messages.reply-in-same-charset
 If this variable is set, mailx first tries to use the same character set of the original message for replies. If this fails, the sendcharsets
 variable is evaluated as usual.Replyall
 Reverses the sense of reply and Reply commands.save

 <br><br>When the user aborts a message with two RUBOUT (interrupt characters) mailx copies the partial letter to the file dead.letter in the home
 directory. This option is set by default.searchheaders
 If this option is set, then a message-list specifier in the form /x:y will expand to all messages containing the substring y in the header
 field x. The string search is case insensitive.sendwait
 When sending a message, wait until the mail transfer agent exits before accepting further commands. If the mail transfer agent returns a non-zero exit
 status, the exit status of mailx will also be non-zero.showlast
 Setting this option causes mailx to start at the last message instead of the first one when opening a mail folder.showname
 Causes mailx to use the senders real name instead of the plain address in the header field summary and in message specifications.showto

 <br><br>Causes the recipient of the message to be shown in the header summary if the message was sent by the user.skipemptybody
 If an outgoing message does not contain any text in its first or only message part, do not send it but discard it silently (see also the -E
 option).smime-force-encryption
 Causes mailx to refuse sending unencrypted messages.smime-sign
 If this variable is set, outgoing messages are S/MIME signed with the users private key. Signing a message enables a recipient to verify that the sender
 used a valid certificate, that the email addresses in the certificate match those in the message header, and that the message content has not been altered. It
 does not change the message text, and people will be able to read the message as usual.smime-no-default-ca
 Do not load the default CA locations when verifying S/MIME signed messages. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.smtp-use-starttls
 Causes mailx to issue a STARTTLS command to make an SMTP session SSL/TLS encrypted. Not all servers support this command; because of common
 implementation defects, it cannot be automatically determined whether a server supports it or not.ssl-no-default-ca
 Do not load the default CA locations to verify SSL/TLS server certificates. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-v2-allow
 Accept SSLv2 connections. These are normally not allowed because this protocol version is insecure.stealthmua
 Inhibits the generation of the Message-Id: and User-Agent: header fields that include obvious references to mailx. There are two
 pitfalls associated with this: First, the message id of outgoing messages is not known anymore. Second, an expert may still use the remaining information in
 the header to track down the originating mail user agent.verbose
 Setting the option verbose is the same as using the -v flag on the command line. When mailx runs in verbose mode, details of the actual message
 delivery and protocol conversations for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP, as well as of other internal processes, are displayed on the users terminal, This is sometimes
 useful to debug problems. Mailx prints all data that is sent to remote servers in clear texts, including passwords, so care should be taken that no
 unauthorized option can view the screen if this option is enabled.writebackedited
 If this variable is set, messages modified using the edit or visual commands are written back to the current folder when it is quit. This is
 only possible for writable folders in mbox format. Setting this variable also disables MIME decoding and decryption for the editing commands.

 <br><br><b>String Options</b>
 attrlist
 A sequence of characters to print in the attribute column of a header summary, each for one type of messages in the following order: new, unread but old,
 new but read, read and old, saved, preserved, mboxed, flagged, answered, draft, killed, start of a collapsed thread, collapsed, classified as junk. The default
 is NUROSPMFATK+-J, or NU *HMFATK+-J if bsdflags or the SYSV3 environment variable are set.autobcc
 Specifies a list of recipients to which a blind carbon copy of each outgoing message will be sent automatically.autocc

 <br><br>Specifies a list of recipients to which a carbon copy of each outgoing message will be sent automatically.autosort
 Causes sorted mode (see the sort command) to be entered automatically with the value of this option as sorting method when a folder is
 opened.cmd

 <br><br>The default value for the pipe command.<br><br><b>crt</b><br><br>The valued option crt is used as a threshold to determine how long a message must be before PAGER is used to read it. If crt is set without a value, then
 the height of the terminal screen stored in the system is used to compute the threshold (see <b><a href=stty>stty</a></b>(1)).<br><br><b>DEAD</b><br><br>The name of the file to use for saving aborted messages. This defaults to dead.letter in the users home directory.<br><br><b>EDITOR</b><br><br>Pathname of the text editor to use in the edit command and ~e escape. If not defined, then a default editor is used.encoding
 The default MIME encoding to use in outgoing text messages and message parts. Valid values are 8bit or quoted-printable. The default is
 8bit. In case the mail transfer system is not ESMTP compliant, quoted-printable should be used instead. If there is no need to encode a message,
 7bit transfer mode is used, without regard to the value of this variable. Binary data is always encoded in base64 mode.escape

 <br><br>If defined, the first character of this option gives the character to use in the place of ~ to denote escapes.<br><br><b>folder</b><br><br>The name of the directory to use for storing folders of messages. All folder names that begin with + refer to files below that directory. If the directory
 name begins with a /, mailx considers it to be an absolute pathname; otherwise, the folder directory is found relative to the users home
 directory.The directory name may also refer to an IMAP account; any names that begin with + then refer to IMAP mailboxes on that account. An IMAP folder is normally
 given in the formimaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example
 <p>In this case, the + and @ prefixes for folder names have the same effect (see the folder command).
 </p>Some IMAP servers do not accept the creation of mailboxes in the hierarchy base; they require that they are created as subfolders of INBOX. With such
 servers, a folder name of the form
 imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example/INBOX.should be used (the last character is the servers hierarchy delimiter). Folder names prefixed by + will then refer to folders below INBOX, while folder
 names prefixed by @ refer to folders below the hierarchy base. See the imap namespace command for a method to detect the appropriate prefix and
 delimiter.folder-hook
 When a folder is opened and this variable is set, the macro corresponding to the value of this variable is executed. The macro is also invoked when new mail
 arrives, but message lists for commands executed from the macro only include newly arrived messages then.folder-hook-fullnameWhen a folder named fullname is opened, the macro corresponding to the value of this variable is executed. Unlike other folder specifications, the
 fully expanded name of a folder, without metacharacters, is used to avoid ambiguities. The macro specified with folder-hook is not executed if this
 variable is effective for a folder (unless it is explicitly invoked within the called macro).from

 <br><br>The address (or a list of addresses) to put into the From: field of the message header. If replying to a message, these addresses are handled as if
 they were in the alternates list. If the machines hostname is not valid at the Internet (for example at a dialup machine), either this variable or
 hostname have to be set to get correct Message-ID header fields. If from contains more than one address, the sender variable must also be
 set.fwdheading
 The string to print before the text of a message with the forward command (unless the forward-as-attachment variable is set). Defaults to
 -------- Original Message -------- if unset. If it is set to the empty string, no heading is printed.headline
 A format string to use for the header summary, similar to printf formats. A % character introduces a format specifier. It may be followed by a
 number indicating the field width. If the field is a number, the width may be negative, which indicates that it is to be left-aligned. Valid format specifiers
 are:The default is %&gt;%a%m %18f %16d %4l/%-5o %i%s, or %&gt;%a%m %20f %16d %3l/%-5o %i%S if bsdcompat is set.hostname
 Use this string as hostname when expanding local addresses instead of the value obtained from <b><a href=/man/2/uname>uname</a></b>(2) and <b><a href=/man/3/getaddrinfo>getaddrinfo</a></b>(3).imap-auth
 Sets the IMAP authentication method. Valid values are login for the usual password-based authentication (the default), cram-md5, which is a
 password-based authentication that does not send the password over the network in clear text, and gssapi for GSSAPI-based authentication.imap-auth-user@hostSets the IMAP authentication method for a specific account.imap-cache
 Enables caching of IMAP mailboxes. The value of this variable must point to a directory that is either existent or can be created by mailx. All
 contents of the cache can be deleted by mailx at any time; it is not safe to make assumptions about them.imap-keepalive
 IMAP servers may close the connection after a period of inactivity; the standard requires this to be at least 30 minutes, but practical experience may vary.
 Setting this variable to a numeric value greater than 0 causes a NOOP command to be sent each value seconds if no other operation is
 performed.imap-list-depth
 When retrieving the list of folders on an IMAP server, the folders command stops after it has reached a certain depth to avoid possible infinite
 loops. The value of this variable sets the maximum depth allowed. The default is 2. If the folder separator on the current IMAP server is a slash /, this
 variable has no effect, and the folders command does not descend to subfolders.indentprefix
 String used by the ~m and ~M tilde escapes and by the quote option for indenting messages, in place of the normal tab character
 (^I). Be sure to quote the value if it contains spaces or tabs.junkdb

 <br><br>The location of the junk mail database. The string is treated like a folder name, as described for the folder command.The files in the junk mail database are normally stored in <b><a href=compress>compress</a></b>(1) format for saving space. If processing time is considered more important,
 <b><a href=uncompress>uncompress</a></b>(1) can be used to store them in plain form. Mailx will then work using the uncompressed files.LISTER

 <br><br>Pathname of the directory lister to use in the folders command when operating on local mailboxes. Default is /bin/ls.<br><br><b>MAIL</b><br><br>Is used as the users mailbox, if set. Otherwise, a system-dependent default is used. Can be a protocol<b>://</b> string (see the folder
 command for more information).MAILX_HEAD
 A string to put at the beginning of each new message. The escape sequences <b>\t</b> (tabulator) and <b>\n</b> (newline) are understood.MAILX_TAIL
 A string to put at the end of each new message. The escape sequences <b>\t</b> (tabulator) and <b>\n</b> (newline) are understood.maximum-unencoded-line-length
 Messages that contain lines longer than the value of this variable are encoded in quoted-printable even if they contain only ASCII characters. The maximum
 effective value is 950. If set to 0, all ASCII text messages are encoded in quoted-printable. S/MIME signed messages are always encoded in quoted-printable
 regardless of the value of this variable.MBOX

 <br><br>The name of the mbox file. It can be the name of a folder. The default is mbox in the users home directory.NAIL_EXTRA_RC
 The name of an optional startup file to be read after ~/.mailrc. This variable is ignored if it is imported from the environment; it has an effect only if
 it is set in /etc/mail.rc or ~/.mailrc to allow bypassing the configuration with e. g. MAILRC=/dev/null. Use this file for commands that are not understood
 by other mailx implementations.newfolders
 If this variable has the value <b>maildir</b>, newly created local folders will be in maildir format.nss-config-dir
 A directory that contains the files certN.db to retrieve certificates, keyN.db to retrieve private keys, and secmod.db, where N is a
 digit. These are usually taken from Mozilla installations, so an appropriate value might be ~/.mozilla/firefox/default.clm. Mailx opens these files
 read-only and does not modify them. However, if the files are modified by Mozilla while mailx is running, it will print a Bad database message. It may
 be necessary to create copies of these files that are exclusively used by mailx then. Only applicable if S/MIME and SSL/TLS support is built using
 Network Security Services (NSS).ORGANIZATION
 The value to put into the Organization: field of the message header.PAGER

 <br><br>Pathname of the program to use in the more command or when crt variable is set. The default paginator <b>pg</b>(1) or, in BSD compatibility mode,
 <b><a href=more rel=nofollow>more</a></b>(1) is used if this option is not defined.password-user@hostSet the password for user when connecting to host. If no such variable is defined for a host, the user will be asked for a password on
 standard input. Specifying passwords in a startup file is generally a security risk, the file should be readable by the invoking user only.pipe-content/subcontentWhen a MIME message part of content/subcontent type is displayed or it is replied to, its text is filtered through the value of this variable
 interpreted as a shell command. Special care must be taken when using such commands as mail viruses may be distributed by this method; if messages of type
 application/x-sh were filtered through the shell, for example, a message sender could easily execute arbitrary code on the system mailx is
 running on.pop3-keepalive
 POP3 servers may close the connection after a period of inactivity; the standard requires this to be at least 10 minutes, but practical experience may vary.
 Setting this variable to a numeric value greater than 0 causes a NOOP command to be sent each value seconds if no other operation is
 performed.prompt

 <br><br>The string printed when a command is accepted. Defaults to <b>?</b> , or to <b>&amp;</b>  if the bsdcompat variable is set.<br><br><b>quote</b><br><br>If set, mailx starts a replying message with the original message prefixed by the value of the variable indentprefix. Normally, a heading
 consisting of Fromheaderfield wrote: is printed before the quotation. If the string noheading is assigned to the quote variable, this heading
 is omitted. If the string headers is assigned, the headers selected by the ignore/retain commands are printed above the message body, thus quote
 acts like an automatic ~m command then. If the string allheaders is assigned, all headers are printed above the message body, and all MIME parts are
 included, thus quote acts like an automatic ~M command then.<br><br><b>record</b><br><br>If defined, gives the pathname of the folder used to record all outgoing mail. If not defined, then outgoing mail is not so saved. When saving to this
 folder fails, the message is not sent but saved to the dead.letter file instead.replyto
 A list of addresses to put into the Reply-To: field of the message header. If replying to a message, such addresses are handled as if they were in
 the alternates list.screen

 <br><br>When mailx initially prints the message headers, it determines the number to print by looking at the speed of the terminal. The faster the terminal,
 the more it prints. This option overrides this calculation and specifies how many message headers are printed. This number is also used for scrolling with the
 z command.sendcharsets
 A comma-separated list of character set names that can be used in Internet mail. When a message that contains characters not representable in US-ASCII is
 prepared for sending, mailx tries to convert its text to each of the given character sets in order and uses the first appropriate one. The default is
 utf-8.Character sets assigned to this variable should be ordered in ascending complexity. That is, the list should start with e.g. iso-8859-1 for compatibility
 with older mail clients, might contain some other language-specific character sets, and should end with utf-8 to handle messages that combine texts in
 multiple languages.sender

 <br><br>An address that is put into the Sender: field of outgoing messages. This field needs not normally be present. It is, however, required if the From:
 field contains more than one address. It can also be used to indicate that a message was sent on behalf of somebody other; in this case, From: should contain
 the address of the person that took responsibility for the message, and Sender: should contain the address of the person that actually sent the message. The
 sender address is handled as if it were in the alternates list.sendmail
 To use an alternate mail delivery system, set this option to the full pathname of the program to use. This should be used with care.SHELL

 <br><br>Pathname of the shell to use in the ! command and the ~! escape. A default shell is used if this option is not defined.
 <br><br><b>Sign</b>
 <br><br><b>sign</b><br><br>A string for use with the ~a command.signature
 Must correspond to the name of a readable file if set. The files content is then appended to each singlepart message and to the first part of each
 multipart message. Be warned that there is no possibility to edit the signature for an individual message.smime-ca-dir
 Specifies a directory with CA certificates for verification of S/MIME signed messages. The format is the same as described in
 <b><a href=/man/3/ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations>ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations</a></b>(3). Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.smime-ca-file
 Specifies a file with CA certificates for verification of S/MIME signed messages. The format is the same as described in
 <b><a href=/man/3/ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations rel=nofollow>ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations</a></b>(3). Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.smime-cipher-user@hostSpecifies a cipher to use when generating S/MIME encrypted messages for user@host. Valid ciphers are <b>rc2-40</b> (RC2 with 40 bits), <b>rc2-64</b>
 (RC2 with 64 bits), <b>des</b> (DES, 56 bits) and <b>des-ede3</b> (3DES, 112/168 bits). The default is 3DES. It is not recommended to use the other ciphers
 unless a recipients client is actually unable to handle 3DES since they are comparatively weak; but even so, the recipient should upgrade his software in
 preference.smime-crl-file
 Specifies a file that contains a CRL in PEM format to use when verifying S/MIME messages. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.smime-crl-dir
 Specifies a directory that contains files with CRLs in PEM format to use when verifying S/MIME messages. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using
 OpenSSL.smime-encrypt-user@hostIf this variable is set, messages to user@host are encrypted before sending. If S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL, the value of the variable must
 be set to the name of a file that contains a certificate in PEM format. If S/MIME support is built using NSS, the value of this variable is ignored, but if
 multiple certificates for user@host are available, the smime-nickname-user@host variable should be set. Otherwise a certificate for the recipient
 is automatically retrieved from the certificate database, if possible.If a message is sent to multiple recipients, each of them for whom a corresponding variable is set will receive an individually encrypted message; other
 recipients will continue to receive the message in plain text unless the smime-force-encryption variable is set. It is recommended to sign encrypted
 messages, i.e. to also set the smime-sign variable.smime-nickname-user@hostSpecifies the nickname of a certificate to be used when encrypting messages for user@host . Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using
 NSS.smime-sign-cert
 Points to a file in PEM format that contains the users private key as well as his certificate. Both are used with S/MIME for signing and decrypting
 messages. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.smime-sign-cert-user@hostOverrides smime-sign-cert for the specific addresses. When signing messages and the value of the from variable is set to user@host, the
 specific file is used. When decrypting messages, their recipient fields (To: and Cc:) are searched for addresses for which such a variable is set. Mailx
 always uses the first address that matches, so if the same message is sent to more than one of the users addresses using different encryption keys, decryption
 might fail. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.smime-sign-nickname
 Specifies that the named certificate be used for signing mail. If this variable is not set, but a single certificate matching the current from
 address is found in the database, that one is used automatically. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using NSS.smime-sign-nickname-user@hostOverrides smime-sign-nickname for a specific address. Only applicable if S/MIME support is built using NSS.smtp

 <br><br>Normally, mailx invokes <b>sendmail</b>(8) directly to transfer messages. If the smtp variable is set, a SMTP connection to the server
 specified by the value of this variable is used instead. If the SMTP server does not use the standard port, a value of server:port can be given, with
 port as a name or as a number.There are two possible methods to get SSL/TLS encrypted SMTP sessions: First, the STARTTLS command can be used to encrypt a session after it has been
 initiated, but before any user-related data has been sent; see smtp-use-starttls above. Second, some servers accept sessions that are encrypted from
 their beginning on. This mode is configured by assigning <b>smtps://</b>server[<b>:</b>port] to the smtp variable.
 <p>The SMTP transfer is executed in a child process; unless either the sendwait or the verbose variable is set, this process runs asynchronously.
 If it receives a TERM signal, it will abort and save the message to the dead.letter file.
 </p>smtp-auth
 Sets the SMTP authentication method. If set to login, or if unset and smtp-auth-user is set, AUTH LOGIN is used. If set to cram-md5, AUTH CRAM-MD5 is
 used; if set to plain, AUTH PLAIN is used. Otherwise, no SMTP authentication is performed.smtp-auth-user@hostOverrides smtp-auth for specific values of sender addresses, depending on the from variable.smtp-auth-password
 Sets the global password for SMTP AUTH. Both user and password have to be given for AUTH LOGIN and AUTH CRAM-MD5.smtp-auth-password-user@hostOverrides smtp-auth-password for specific values of sender addresses, depending on the from variable.smtp-auth-user
 Sets the global user name for SMTP AUTH. Both user and password have to be given for AUTH LOGIN and AUTH CRAM-MD5.If this variable is set but neither smtp-auth-password or a matching smtp-auth-password-user@host can be found, mailx will as for a
 password on the users terminal.smtp-auth-user-user@hostOverrides smtp-auth-user for specific values of sender addresses, depending on the from variable.ssl-ca-dir
 Specifies a directory with CA certificates for verification of SSL/TLS server certificates. See <b><a href=/man/3/ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations rel=nofollow>ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations</a></b>(3) for more
 information. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-ca-file
 Specifies a file with CA certificates for verification of SSL/TLS server certificates. See <b><a href=/man/3/ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations rel=nofollow>ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations</a></b>(3) for more information.
 Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-cert
 Sets the file name for a SSL/TLS client certificate required by some servers. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-cert-user@hostSets an account-specific file name for a SSL/TLS client certificate required by some servers. Overrides ssl-cert for the specified account. Only
 applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-cipher-list
 Specifies a list of ciphers for SSL/TLS connections. See <b><a href=ciphers>ciphers</a></b>(1) for more information. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-crl-file
 Specifies a file that contains a CRL in PEM format to use when verifying SSL/TLS server certificates. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using
 OpenSSL.ssl-crl-dir
 Specifies a directory that contains files with CRLs in PEM format to use when verifying SSL/TLS server certificates. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is
 built using OpenSSL.ssl-key
 Sets the file name for the private key of a SSL/TLS client certificate. If unset, the name of the certificate file is used. The file is expected to be in
 PEM format. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-key-user@hostSets an account-specific file name for the private key of a SSL/TLS client certificate. Overrides ssl-key for the specified account. Only applicable
 if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-method
 Selects a SSL/TLS protocol version; valid values are ssl2, ssl3, and tls1. If unset, the method is selected automatically, if possible.ssl-method-user@hostOverrides ssl-method for a specific account.ssl-rand-egd
 Gives the pathname to an entropy daemon socket, see <b><a href=/man/3/rand_egd>rand_egd</a></b>(3).ssl-rand-file
 Gives the pathname to a file with entropy data, see <b><a href=/man/3/rand_load_file>rand_load_file</a></b>(3). If the file is a regular file writable by the invoking user, new data is
 written to it after it has been loaded. Only applicable if SSL/TLS support is built using OpenSSL.ssl-verify
 Sets the action to be performed if an error occurs during SSL/TLS server certificate validation. Valid values are strict (fail and close connection
 immediately), ask (ask whether to continue on standard input), warn (print a warning and continue), ignore (do not perform validation). The default is
 ask.ssl-verify-user@hostOverrides ssl-verify for a specific account.toplines
 If defined, gives the number of lines of a message to be printed out with the top command; normally, the first five lines are printed.ttycharset
 The character set of the terminal mailx operates on. There is normally no need to set this variable since mailx can determine this
 automatically by looking at the LC_CTYPE locale setting; if this succeeds, the value is assigned at startup and will be displayed by the set command.
 Note that this is not necessarily a character set name that can be used in Internet messages.VISUAL

 <br><br><b>Getting started</b>
 mailx <br><br>If, while you are composing the message you decide that you do not wish to send it after all, you can abort the letter with a RUBOUT . Typing
 a single RUBOUT causes mailx to print (Interrupt -- one more to kill letter). Typing a second RUBOUT causes mailx
 to save your partial letter on the file dead.letter in your home directory and abort the letter. Once you have sent mail to someone, there is no way to undo
 the act, so be careful.<br><br>If you want to send the same message to several other people, you can list their email addresses on the command line. Thus,    $ mailx <br><br>To read your mail, simply type    $ mailxMailxN next to them in the header

 O 2 sam@friends.example  Thu Sep  2 00:08  30/895type 1tto type the current message. As a further shorthand, you can type a message by simply giving its message number. Hence,
 <br><br>Frequently, it is useful to read the messages in your mailbox in order, one after another. You can read the next message in mailx by simply typing a
 newline. As a special case, you can type a newline as your first command to mailx to type the first message.<br><br>If, after typing a message, you wish to immediately send a reply, you can do so with the reply command. This command, like type, takes a
 message number as an argument. mailx then begins a message addressed to the user who sent you the message. You may then type in your letter in reply,
 followed by a &lt;control-d&gt; at the beginning of a line, as before.<br><br>Note that mailx copies the subject header from the original message. This is useful in that correspondence about a particular matter will tend to
 retain the same subject heading, making it easy to recognize. If there are other header fields in the message, like Cc:, the information found will also be
 used.<br><br>Sometimes you will receive a message that has been sent to several people and wish to reply only to the person who sent it. Reply with a capital
 R replies to a message, but sends a copy to the sender only.<br><br>If you wish, while reading your mail, to send a message to someone, but not as a reply to one of your messages, you can send the message directly with the
 mail command, which takes as arguments the names of the recipients you wish to send to. For example, to send a message to &lt;frank@machine.example&gt;,
 you would do:mail <br><br>Many features of mailx can be tailored to your liking with the set command. The set command has two forms, depending on whether you are
 setting a binary option or a valued option. Binary options are either on or off. For example, the askcc option informs mailx that
 each time you send a message, you want it to prompt you for a Cc: header, to be included in the message. To set the askcc option, you would typeset askccset record=Sent<br><br>Mailx includes a simple facility for maintaining groups of messages together in folders. To use the folder facility, you must tell mailx where
 you wish to keep your folders. Each folder of messages will be a single file. For convenience, all of your folders are kept in a single directory of your
 choosing. To tell mailx where your folder directory is, put a line of the formset folder=letters

 <br><br>Anywhere a file name is expected, you can use a folder name, preceded with +. For example, to put a message into a folder with the save command,
 you can use:save +classwork

 <br><br>In order to make a copy of a message in a folder without causing that message to be removed from your system mailbox, use the copy command, which is
 identical in all other respects to the save command.<br><br>The folder command can be used to direct mailx to the contents of a different folder. For example,folder +classwork

 shell command, or do some other auxiliary function. Mailx provides these capabilities through tilde escapes , which consist of a tilde (~) at the
 beginning of a line, followed by a single character which indicates the function to be performed. For example, to print the text of the message so far, use:~pwhich will print a line of dashes, the recipients of your message, and the text of the message so far. A list of the most important tilde escapes is
 available with ~?.

 avoid typing that many characters every time you want to connect:shortcut %:imaps://mylogin@server.myisp.example

 set NAIL_EXTRA_RC=~/.nailrc

 <br><br>If you want to use more than one IMAP mailbox on a server, or if you want to use the IMAP server for mail storage too, the account command (which is
 also mailx-specific) is more appropriate than the shortcut command. You can put the following in ~/.nailrc:account {
         set folder=imaps://mylogin@server.myisp.example
 set record=+SentMBOX=+mboxoutfolder
     }and can then access incoming mail for this account by invoking <br><br>Mailx will ask you for a password string each time you connect to a remote account. If you can reasonably trust the security of your workstation, you

 <br><br>Mailx supports different authentication methods for both IMAP and POP3. If Kerberos is used at your location, you can try to activate GSSAPI-based
 authentication byset imap-auth=gssapiThe advantage of this method is that set imap-auth=cram-md5
     set pop3-use-apopfor IMAP and POP3, respectively, offer authentication methods that avoid to send the password in clear text over the network, which is especially important
 if SSL/TLS cannot be used. If the server does not offer any of these authentication methods, conventional user/password based authentication must be used. It
 is sometimes helpful to set the <br><br>If you regularly use the same workstation to access IMAP accounts, you can greatly enhance performance by enabling local caching of IMAP messages. For any
 message that has been fully or partially fetched from the server, a local copy is made and is used when the message is accessed again, so most data is
 transferred over the network once only. To enable the IMAP cache, select a local directory name and putset imap-cache=~/localdirectory

 <br><br>Once the cache contains some messages, it is not strictly necessary anymore to open a connection to the IMAP server to access them. When mailx is
 invoked with the -D option, or when the disconnected variable is set, only cached data is used for any folder you open. Messages that have not
 yet been completely cached are not available then, but all other messages can be handled as usual. Changes made to IMAP mailboxes in disconnected mode
 are committed to the IMAP server next time it is used in online mode. Synchronizing the local status with the status on the server is thus partially
 within your responsibility; if you forget to initiate a connection to the server again before you leave your location, changes made on one workstation are not
 available on others. Also if you alter IMAP mailboxes from a workstation while uncommitted changes are still pending on another, the latter data may become
 invalid. The same might also happen because of internal server status changes. You should thus carefully evaluate this feature in your environment before you
 rely on it.<br><br>Many servers will close the connection after a short period of inactivity. Use one ofset pop3-keepalive=30

 <br><br>If you encounter problems connecting to a SSL/TLS server, try the ssl-rand-egd and ssl-rand-file variables (see the OpenSSL FAQ for more
 information) or specify the protocol version with ssl-method. Contact your ISP if you need a client certificate or if verification of the server

 <br><br><b>Activating the Bayesian filter</b>
 <br><br>To use the Bayesian filter, a location for the junk mail database must be defined first:set junkdb=~/.junkdb

 <br><br>If you have sufficient disk space (several 10 MB) available, it is recommended that you set the chained-junk-tokens option. The filter will then also
 consider two-word tokens, improving its accuracy.<br><br>A set of good messages and junk messages must now be available; it is also possible to use the incoming new messages for this purpose, although it will of
 course take some time until the filter becomes useful then. Do not underestimate the amount of statistical data needed; some hundred messages are typically
 necessary to get satisfactory results, and many thousand messages for best operation. You have to pass the good messages to the good command, and the
 junk messages to the junk command. If you ever accidentally mark a good message as junk or vice-versa, call the ungood or unjunk command
 to correct this.<br><br>Once a reasonable amount of statistics has been collected, new messages can be classified automatically. The classify command marks all messages that
 the filter considers to be junk, but it does not perform any action on them by default. It is recommended that you move these messages into a separate folder
 just for the case that false positives occur, or to pass them to the junk command later again to further improve the junk mail database. To
 automatically move incoming junk messages every time the inbox is opened, put lines like the following into your .scores file (or whatever name you gave
 to the file in the last example):define classify (smaller ) :n
         move :j set folder-hook-imap://user@host/INBOX=<br><br>If a junk message was not recognized as such, use the junk command to correct this. Also if you encounter a false positive (a good message that was
 wrongly classified as junk), pass it to the good command.<br><br>Since the classify command must examine the entire text of all new messages in the respective folder, this will also cause all of them to be
 downloaded from the IMAP server. You should thus restrict the size of messages for automatic filtering. If server-based filtering is also available, you might
 try if that works for you first.

 set pipe-application/pdf=cat >/tmp/<br><br><b>Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME</b>
 <br><br>A central concept to S/MIME is that of the certification authority (CA). A CA is a trusted institution that issues certificates. For each of these
 certificates, it can be verified that it really originates from the CA, provided that the CAs own certificate is previously known. A set of CA certificates is
 usually delivered with OpenSSL and installed on your system. If you trust the source of your OpenSSL software installation, this offers reasonable security for
 S/MIME on the Internet. In general, a certificate cannot be more secure than the method its CA certificate has been retrieved with, though. Thus if you
 download a CA certificate from the Internet, you can only trust the messages you verify using that certificate as much as you trust the download process.<br><br>The first thing you need for participating in S/MIME message exchange is your personal certificate, including a private key. The certificate contains public
 information, in particular your name and your email address, and the public key that is used by others to encrypt messages for you, and to verify signed
 messages they supposedly received from you. The certificate is included in each signed message you send. The private key must be kept secret. It is used to
 decrypt messages that were previously encrypted with your public key, and to sign messages.<br><br>For personal use, it is recommended that you get a S/MIME certificate from one of the major CAs on the Internet using your WWW browser. (Many CAs offer such
 certificates for free.) You will usually receive a combined certificate and private key in PKCS#12 format which mailx does not directly accept if S/MIME
 support is built using OpenSSL. To convert it to PEM format, use the following shell command:    $ openssl pkcs12 -in -out -clcerts \
         -nodesIf you omit the set smime-sign-cert-myname@myisp.example=cert.pem

 <br><br>If S/MIME support is built using NSS, the PKCS#12 file must be installed using Mozilla (provided that nss-config-dir is set appropriately, see
 above), and no further action is necessary unless multiple user certificates for the same email address are installed. In this case, the
 smime-sign-nickname variable has to be set appropriately.<br><br>You can now sign outgoing messages. Just useset smime-signto do so.
 <br><br>From each signed message you send, the recipient can fetch your certificate and use it to send encrypted mail back to you. Accordingly if somebody sends you
 a signed message, you can do the same. First use the verify command to check the validity of the certificate. After that, retrieve the certificate and
 tell mailx that it should use it for encryption:certsave set smime-encrypt-user@host=filename

 <br><br>You should carefully consider if you prefer to store encrypted messages in decrypted form. If you do, anybody who has access to your mail folders can read
 them, but if you do not, you might be unable to read them yourself later if you happen to lose your private key. The decrypt command saves messages in
 decrypted form, while the save, copy, and move commands leave them encrypted.<br><br>Note that neither S/MIME signing nor encryption applies to message subjects or other header fields. Thus they may not contain sensitive information for
 encrypted messages, and cannot be trusted even if the message content has been verified. When sending signed messages, it is recommended to repeat any
 important header information in the message text.

 <br><br><b>Using CRLs with S/MIME or SSL/TLS</b>
 <br><br>If S/MIME and SSL/TLS support are built using OpenSSL, mailx accepts CRLs in PEM format only; CRLs in DER format must be converted, e.g. with the
 shell command    $ openssl crl -inform DER -in -out <br><br>If S/MIME and SSL/TLS support are built using NSS, CRLs can be imported in Mozilla applications (provided that nss-config-dir is set
 appropriately).

 runs on. If the message Cannot convert from a to b appears, either some characters within the message header or text are not appropriate for
 the currently selected terminal character set, or the needed conversion is not supported by the system. In the first case, it is necessary to set an
 appropriate LC_CTYPE locale (e.g. en_US) or the ttycharset variable. In the second case, the sendcharsets and ttycharset variables
 must be set to the same value to inhibit character set conversion. If iconv() is not available at all, the value assigned to sendcharsets must
 match the character set that is used on the terminal.<br><br>Mailx expects input text to be in Unix format, with lines separated by newline (^J, \n) characters only. Non-Unix text files that use carriage

 <br><br>Limitations with IMAP mailboxes are: It is not possible to edit messages, but it is possible to append them. Thus to edit a message, create a local copy of
 it, edit it, append it, and delete the original. The line count for the header display is only appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded from the
 server. The marking of messages as new is performed by the IMAP server; use of the exit command instead of quit will not cause it to be reset,
 and if the autoinc/newmail variables are unset, messages that arrived during a session will not be in state new anymore when the folder is
 opened again. Also if commands queued in disconnected mode are committed, the IMAP server will delete the new flag for all messages in the changed folder,
 and new messages will appear as unread when it is selected for viewing later. The flagged, answered, and draft attributes are usually permanent, but some
 IMAP servers are known to drop them without notification. Message numbers may change with IMAP every time before the prompt is printed if mailx is
 notified by the server that messages have been deleted by some other client or process. In this case, Expunged n messages is printed, and message
 numbers may have changed.<br><br>Limitations with POP3 mailboxes are: It is not possible to edit messages, they can only be copied and deleted. The line count for the header display is only
 appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded from the server. The status field of a message is maintained by the server between connections; some
 servers do not update it at all, and with a server that does, the exit command will not cause the message status to be reset. The newmail command and the

 aborted, and will then return to the command loop and print the prompt again. When a second RUBOUT is typed while mailx is waiting for the
 operation to complete, the operation itself will be canceled. In this case, data that has not been fetched yet will have to be fetched before the next command
 can be performed. If the canceled operation was using an SSL/TLS encrypted channel, an error in the SSL transport will very likely result, and the connection
 is no longer usable.<br><br>As mailx is a mail user agent, it provides only basic SMTP services. If it fails to contact its upstream SMTP server, it will not make further
 attempts to transfer the message at a later time, and it does not leave other information about this condition than an error message on the terminal and a
 dead.letter file. This is usually not a problem if the SMTP server is located in the same local network as the computer on which mailx is run.
 However, care should be taken when using a remote server of an ISP; it might be better to set up a local SMTP server then which just acts as a proxy.<br><br>Mailx immediately contacts the SMTP server (or /usr/lib/sendmail) even when operating in disconnected mode. It would not make much
 sense for mailx to defer outgoing mail since SMTP servers usually provide much more elaborated delay handling than mailx could perform as a
 client. Thus the recommended setup for sending mail in disconnected mode is to configure a local SMTP server such that it sends outgoing mail as soon as
 an external network connection is available again, i.e. to advise it to do that from a network startup script.<br><br>The junk mail filter follows the concepts developed by Paul Graham in his articles, A Plan for Spam, August 2002,

 <br><br><b>sudoers</b> - default sudo security policy module"},{"id": 18255,"commandid" : 2426,"title": "Description","page": "


 <br><br>The sudoers policy module determines a users <b>sudo</b> privileges. It is the default <b>sudo</b> policy plugin. The policy is driven by the
 /etc/sudoers file or, optionally in LDAP. The policy format is described in detail in the SUDOERS FILE FORMAT section. For information on storing
 sudoers policy information in LDAP, please see <b><a href=sudoers.ldap>sudoers.ldap</a></b>(5).<br><br><b>Authentication and logging</b><br><br>The sudoers security policy requires that most users authenticate themselves before they can use <b>sudo</b>. A password is not required if the
 invoking user is root, if the target user is the same as the invoking user, or if the policy has disabled authentication for the user or command. Unlike <b><a href=/man/1/su>su</a></b>(1),
 when sudoers requires authentication, it validates the invoking users credentials, not the target users (or roots) credentials. This can be changed
 via the rootpw, targetpw and runaspw flags, described later.<br><br>If a user who is not listed in the policy tries to run a command via <b>sudo</b>, mail is sent to the proper authorities. The address used for such mail is
 configurable via the mailto Defaults entry (described later) and defaults to root.<br><br>Note that mail will not be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-l</b> or <b>-v</b> option. This allows users to determine for
 themselves whether or not they are allowed to use <b>sudo</b>.<br><br>If <b>sudo</b> is run by root and the SUDO_USER environment variable is set, the sudoers policy will use this value to determine who the actual user
 is. This can be used by a user to log commands through sudo even when a root shell has been invoked. It also allows the <b>-e</b> option to remain useful even
 when invoked via a sudo-run script or program. Note, however, that the sudoers lookup is still done for root, not the user specified by SUDO_USER.<br><br>sudoers uses time stamp files for credential caching. Once a user has been authenticated, the time stamp is updated and the user may then use sudo
 without a password for a short period of time (                                                           5 minutes unlessoverridden by the <a href=/man/3/syslog>syslog</a>(3), a log file, or both.  By default, <a href=/man/3/syslog rel=nofollow>syslog</a>(3) but this is changeable via the Command environment     Since environment variables can influence program behavior, bash functions.  The list ofenvironment variables that sudo allows or denies is contained in theoutput of sudo -V when run as root.
 Note that the dynamic linker on most operating systems will removevariables that can control dynamic linking from the environment of setuidexecutables, including sudo.  Depending on the operating system this mayinclude _RLD*, DYLD_*, LD_*, LDR_*, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, and others.These type of variables are removed from the environment before sudo evenbegins execution and, as such, it is not possible for sudo to preservethem.

 <br><br>The sudoers file is composed of two types of entries: aliases (basically variables) and user specifications (which specify who may run what).<br><br>When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order. Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not necessarily the
 most specific match).<br><br>The sudoers grammar will be described below in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). Dont despair if you are unfamiliar with EBNF; it is fairly simple,
 and the definitions below are annotated.<br><br><b>Quick guide to EBNF</b><br><br>EBNF is a concise and exact way of describing the grammar of a language. Each EBNF definition is made up of production rules. E.g.,<br><br>symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...<br><br>Each production rule references others and thus makes up a grammar for the language. EBNF also contains the following operators, which many readers
 will recognize from regular expressions. Do not, however, confuse them with wildcard characters, which have different meanings.?      Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) isoptional.  That is, it may appear once or not at all.<br><br>+ Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear one or more times.<br><br>Parentheses may be used to group symbols together. For clarity, we will use single quotes () to designate what is a verbatim character string (as opposed
 to a symbol name).<br><br><b>Aliases</b><br>
 There are four kinds of aliases: User_Alias, Runas_Alias, Host_Alias and Cmnd_Alias.<br><br>Alias ::= User_Alias User_Alias (: User_Alias)* |<br>
 Runas_Alias Runas_Alias (: Runas_Alias)* |<br>
 Host_Alias Host_Alias (: Host_Alias)* |<br>
 Cmnd_Alias Cmnd_Alias (: Cmnd_Alias)*<br><br>User_Alias ::= NAME = User_List<br><br>Runas_Alias ::= NAME = Runas_List<br><br>Host_Alias ::= NAME = Host_List<br><br>Cmnd_Alias ::= NAME = Cmnd_List<br><br>NAME ::= [A-Z]([A-Z][0-9]_)*<br><br>Each alias definition is of the formAlias_Type NAME = item1, item2, ...must start with an uppercase letter. It is possible to put several alias definitions of the same type on a single line, joined
 by a colon (:). E.g.,
 <br><br>A user name, uid, group, gid, netgroup, nonunix_group or nonunix_gid may be enclosed in double quotes to avoid the need for escaping special characters.
 Alternately, special characters may be specified in escaped hex mode, e.g. \x20 for space. When using double quotes, any prefix characters must be included
 inside the quotes.<br><br>The actual nonunix_group and nonunix_gid syntax depends on the underlying group provider plugin (see the group_plugin description below). For
 instance, the QAS AD plugin supports the following formats:
 •   Group in the same domain: %:Group Name• Group in any domain: %:Group Name@FULLY.QUALIFIED.DOMAIN
 <br><br><b>•</b> Group SID: %:S-1-2-34-5678901234-5678901234-5678901234-567<br><br>Note that quotes around group names are optional. Unquoted strings must use a backslash (\) to escape spaces and special characters. See Other special
 characters and reserved words for a list of characters that need to be escaped.<br><br>Runas_List ::= Runas_Member |<br>
 Runas_Member , Runas_List<br><br>Runas_Member ::= !* user name |<br>
 !* #uid |<br>
 !* %group |<br>
 !* %#gid |<br>
 !* %:nonunix_group |<br>
 !* %:#nonunix_gid |<br>
 !* +netgroup |<br>
 !* Runas_Alias<br><br>A Runas_List is similar to a User_List except that instead of User_Aliases it can contain Runas_Aliases. Note that user names and groups are matched as
 strings. In other words, two users (groups) with the same uid (gid) are considered to be distinct. If you wish to match all user names with the same uid (e.g.
 root and toor), you can use a uid instead (#0 in the example given).Host_List ::= Host |
         Host , Host_List

 Host ::= !* host name |
    !* ip_addr |
    !* network(/netmask)? |
    !* +netgroup |
    !* Host_Aliassudo will query each of the local hosts
 network interfaces and, if the network number corresponds to one of the hostss network interfaces, the corresponding netmask will be used. The netmask may be
 specified either in standard IP address notation (e.g. 255.255.255.0 or ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::), or CIDR notation (number of bits, e.g. 24 or 64). A host name
 may include shell-style wildcards (see the sudo only inspects actual network interfaces; this means that IP
 address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) will never match. Also, the host name localhost will only match if that is the actual host name, which is usually only the
 case for non-networked systems.
 without command line arguments. A directory is a fully qualified path name ending in a /. When you specify a directory in a Cmnd_List, the user will
 be able to run any file within that directory (but not in any sub-directories therein).
 <br><br>If a Cmnd has associated command line arguments, then the arguments in the Cmnd must match exactly those given by the user on the command line (or match the
 wildcards if there are any). Note that the following characters must be escaped with a \ if they are used in command arguments: ,, :, =, \. The
 special command sudoedit is used to permit a user to run <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-e</b> option (or as <b>sudoedit</b>). It may take command line arguments
 just as a normal command does.

 <br><br><b>Defaults</b>
 flags, integer values, strings, or lists. Flags are implicitly boolean and can be turned off via the !
 operator. Some integer, string and list parameters may also be used in a boolean context to disable them. Values may be enclosed in double quotes () when
 they contain multiple words. Special characters may be escaped with a backslash (\).
 <br><br>Lists have two additional assignment operators, += and -=. These operators are used to add to and delete from a list respectively. It is not an error to use
 the -= operator to remove an element that does not exist in a list.<br><br>Defaults entries are parsed in the following order: generic, host and user Defaults first, then runas Defaults and finally command defaults.<br><br>See SUDOERS OPTIONS for a list of supported Defaults parameters.

 <br><br><b>User specification</b>
 user specification determines which commands a user may run (and as what user) on specified hosts. By default, commands are run as root, but
 this can be changed on a per-command basis.
 <br><br>The basic structure of a user specification is who where = (as_whom) what. Lets break that down into its constituent parts:

 <br><br><b>Runas_Spec</b>
 sudos
 -u option. The second defines a list of groups that can be specified via sudos -g option. If both Runas_Lists are specified, the command
 may be run with any combination of users and groups listed in their respective Runas_Lists. If only the first is specified, the command may be run as any user
 in the list but no -g option may be specified. If the first Runas_List is empty but the second is specified, the command may be run as the invoking user
 with the group set to any listed in the Runas_List. If both Runas_Lists are empty, the command may only be run as the invoking user. If no Runas_Spec is
 specified the command may be run as root and no group may be specified.
 <br><br>A Runas_Spec sets the default for the commands that follow it. What this means is that for the entry:dgb     boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprmdgb may run operator. E.g.,
 dgb is now allowed to run operator, but root.

 <br><br>We can extend this to allow <b>dgb</b> to run /bin/ls with either the user or group set to <b>operator</b>:dgb     boulder = (operator : operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill,\/usr/bin/lprmNote that while the group portion of the Runas_Spec permits the user to run as command with that group, it does not force the user to do so. If no group is
 specified on the command line, the command will run with the group listed in the target users password database entry. The following would all be permitted by
 the tcm may run commands that access a modem device file with the dialer group.
 /usr/local/bin/minicomNote that in this example only the group will be set, the command still runs as user tcm. E.g.
 -u and
 -g options. In this example:
 alan may run any command as either user root or bin, optionally setting the group to operator or system.
 <br><br><b>SELinux_Spec</b>
 <br><br><b>Tag_Spec</b>
 <br><br>NOPASSWD and PASSWD<br><br>By default, <b>sudo</b> requires that a user authenticate him or herself before running a command. This behavior can be modified via the NOPASSWD tag. Like
 a Runas_Spec, the NOPASSWD tag sets a default for the commands that follow it in the Cmnd_Spec_List. Conversely, the PASSWD tag can be used to reverse things.
 For example:ray     rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprmray to run root on the machine rushmore without
 authenticating himself. If we only want ray to be able to run <br><br>By default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of the entries for a user on the current host, he or she will be able to run sudo -l without a
 password. Additionally, a user may only run sudo -v without a password if the NOPASSWD tag is present for all a users entries that pertain to the current
 host. This behavior may be overridden via the verifypw and listpw options.<br><br>NOEXEC and EXEC<br><br>If <b>sudo</b> has been compiled with noexec support and the underlying operating system supports it, the NOEXEC tag can be used to prevent a
 dynamically-linked executable from running further commands itself.<br><br>In the following example, user <b>aaron</b> may run /usr/bin/more and /usr/bin/vi but shell escapes will be disabled.aaron   shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi<br><br>SETENV and NOSETENV<br><br>These tags override the value of the setenv option on a per-command basis. Note that if SETENV has been set for a command, the user may disable the
 env_reset option from the command line via the <b>-E</b> option. Additionally, environment variables set on the command line are not subject to the
 restrictions imposed by env_check, env_delete, or env_keep. As such, only trusted users should be allowed to set variables in this manner.
 If the command matched is <b>ALL</b>, the SETENV tag is implied for that command; this default may be overridden by use of the NOSETENV tag.<br><br>LOG_INPUT and NOLOG_INPUT<br><br>These tags override the value of the log_input option on a per-command basis. For more information, see the description of log_input in the
 SUDOERS OPTIONS section below.<br><br>LOG_OUTPUT and NOLOG_OUTPUT<br><br>These tags override the value of the log_output option on a per-command basis. For more information, see the description of log_output in the
 SUDOERS OPTIONS section below.

 <br><br><b>Wildcards</b>
 sudo allows shell-style POSIX <a href=/man/3/glob>glob</a>(3) and <a href=/man/3/fnmatch>fnmatch</a>(3) routines. Note that these are ? Matches any single character.
 <p>[...] Matches any character in the specified range.
 </p><p>[!...] Matches any character <b>not</b> in the specified range.
 </p><p>\x For any character x, evaluates to x. This is used to escape special characters such as: *, ?, [, and ].
 </p><p>POSIX character classes may also be used if your systems <b><a href=/man/3/glob rel=nofollow>glob</a></b>(3) and <b><a href=/man/3/fnmatch rel=nofollow>fnmatch</a></b>(3) functions support them. However, because the : character has special
 meaning in sudoers, it must be escaped. For example:
 </p><p>/bin/ls [[alpha]]*
 </p><p>Would match any file name beginning with a letter.
 </p><p>Note that a forward slash (/) will <b>not</b> be matched by wildcards used in the path name. This is to make a path like:
 </p>/usr/bin/*match /usr/bin/who but not /usr/bin/X11/xterm.
 <p>When matching the command line arguments, however, a slash <b>does</b> get matched by wildcards since command line arguments may contain arbitrary strings
 and not just path names.
 </p><p>Wildcards in command line arguments should be used with care. Because command line arguments are matched as a single, concatenated string, a wildcard such
 as ? or * can match multiple words. For example, while a sudoers entry like:
 </p>%operator ALL = /bin/cat /var/log/messages*will allow command like:
 $ sudo cat /var/log/messages.1It will also allow:
 $ sudo cat /var/log/messages /etc/shadowwhich is probably not what was intended.

 <br><br><b>Exceptions to wildcard rules</b>
 The following exceptions apply to the above rules:
 any arguments.sudoedit<br>
 Command line arguments to the sudoedit built-in command should always be path names, so a forward slash (/) will not be matched by a wildcard.

 <p><b>Including other files from within sudoers</b><br>
 It is possible to include other sudoers files from within the sudoers file currently being parsed using the #include and #includedir directives.

 </p><p>This can be used, for example, to keep a site-wide sudoers file in addition to a local, per-machine file. For the sake of this example the site-wide
 sudoers will be /etc/sudoers and the per-machine one will be /etc/sudoers.local. To include /etc/sudoers.local from within
 /etc/sudoers we would use the following line in /etc/sudoers:
 </p><p>#include /etc/sudoers.local
 </p><p>When <b>sudo</b> reaches this line it will suspend processing of the current file (/etc/sudoers) and switch to /etc/sudoers.local. Upon
 reaching the end of /etc/sudoers.local, the rest of /etc/sudoers will be processed. Files that are included may themselves include other files. A
 hard limit of 128 nested include files is enforced to prevent include file loops.
 </p><p>If the path to the include file is not fully-qualified (does not begin with a /, it must be located in the same directory as the sudoers file it was
 included from. For example, if /etc/sudoers contains the line:
 </p>#include sudoers.localthe file that will be included is /etc/sudoers.local.
 <p>The file name may also include the %h escape, signifying the short form of the host name. In other words, if the machines host name is xerxes, then

 </p>#include /etc/sudoers.%hwill cause <b>sudo</b> to include the file /etc/sudoers.xerxes.
 <p>The #includedir directive can be used to create a sudo.d directory that the system package manager can drop sudoers rules into as part of
 package installation. For example, given:
 </p>#includedir /etc/sudoers.d<b>sudo</b> will read each file in /etc/sudoers.d, skipping file names that end in ~ or contain a . character to avoid causing problems with
 package manager or editor temporary/backup files. Files are parsed in sorted lexical order. That is, /etc/sudoers.d/01_first will be parsed before
 /etc/sudoers.d/10_second. Be aware that because the sorting is lexical, not numeric, /etc/sudoers.d/1_whoops would be loaded <b>after</b>
 /etc/sudoers.d/10_second. Using a consistent number of leading zeroes in the file names can be used to avoid such problems.
 <p>Note that unlike files included via #include, <b>visudo</b> will not edit the files in a #includedir directory unless one of them contains a syntax error.
 It is still possible to run <b>visudo</b> with the <b>-f</b> flag to edit the files directly.
 </p>

 <br><br><b>Other special characters and reserved words</b>
 The pound sign (#) is used to indicate a comment (unless it is part of a #include directive or unless it occurs in the context of a user name and is
 followed by one or more digits, in which case it is treated as a uid). Both the comment character and any text after it, up to the end of the line, are
 ignored.
 <p>The reserved word <b>ALL</b> is a built-in alias that always causes a match to succeed. It can be used wherever one might otherwise use a Cmnd_Alias,
 User_Alias, Runas_Alias, or Host_Alias. You should not try to define your own alias called <b>ALL</b> as the built-in alias will be used in preference
 to your own. Please note that using <b>ALL</b> can be dangerous since in a command context, it allows the user to run <b>any</b> command on the system.

 </p><p>An exclamation point (!) can be used as a logical not operator both in an alias and in front of a Cmnd. This allows one to exclude certain
 values. Note, however, that using a ! in conjunction with the built-in <b>ALL</b> alias to allow a user to run all but a few commands rarely works as
 intended (see SECURITY NOTES below).
 </p><p>Long lines can be continued with a backslash (\) as the last character on the line.

 <br><br><b>sudo</b>s behavior can be modified by Default_Entry lines, as explained earlier. A list of all supported Defaults parameters, grouped by type, are
 listed below.<br><br><b>Boolean Flags</b>:always_set_homeIf enabled, <b>sudo</b> will set the HOME environment variable to the home directory of the target user (which is root unless the <b>-u</b> option is used).
 This effectively means that the <b>-H</b> option is always implied. Note that HOME is already set when the the env_reset option is enabled, so
 always_set_home is only effective for configurations where either env_reset is disabled or HOME is present in the env_keep list. This flag
 is off by default.
 <p>authenticate If set, users must authenticate themselves via a password (or other means of authentication) before they may run commands. This default may be
 overridden via the PASSWD and NOPASSWD tags. This flag is on by default.
 </p><p>closefrom_override<br>
 If set, the user may use <b>sudo</b>s <b>-C</b> option which overrides the default starting point at which <b>sudo</b> begins closing open file descriptors.
 This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>compress_io If set, and <b>sudo</b> is configured to log a commands input or output, the I/O logs will be compressed using <b>zlib</b>. This flag is
 on by default when <b>sudo</b> is compiled with <b>zlib</b> support.
 </p><p>env_editor If set, <b>visudo</b> will use the value of the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables before falling back on the default editor list. Note that
 this may create a security hole as it allows the user to run any arbitrary command as root without logging. A safer alternative is to place a colon-separated
 list of editors in the editor variable. <b>visudo</b> will then only use the EDITOR or VISUAL if they match a value specified in editor. This flag is on
 by default.
 </p><p>env_reset If set, <b>sudo</b> will run the command in a minimal environment containing the TERM, PATH, HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME and
 SUDO_* variables. Any variables in the callers environment that match the env_keep and env_check lists are then added, followed by any variables present in
 the file specified by the env_file option (if any). The default contents of the env_keep and env_check lists are displayed when <b>sudo</b> is run by
 root with the <b>-V</b> option. If the secure_path option is set, its value will be used for the PATH environment variable. This flag is on by
 default.
 </p><p>fast_glob Normally, <b>sudo</b> uses the <b><a href=/man/3/glob rel=nofollow>glob</a></b>(3) function to do shell-style globbing when matching path names. However, since it accesses the file system,
 <b><a href=/man/3/glob rel=nofollow>glob</a></b>(3) can take a long time to complete for some patterns, especially when the pattern references a network file system that is mounted on demand (auto
 mounted). The fast_glob option causes <b>sudo</b> to use the <b><a href=/man/3/fnmatch rel=nofollow>fnmatch</a></b>(3) function, which does not access the file system to do its matching. The
 disadvantage of fast_glob is that it is unable to match relative path names such as ./ls or ../bin/ls. This has security implications when
 path names that include globbing characters are used with the negation operator, !, as such rules can be trivially bypassed. As such, this option should not
 be used when sudoers contains rules that contain negated path names which include globbing characters. This flag is off by default.

 </p><p>fqdn Set this flag if you want to put fully qualified host names in the sudoers file when the local host name (as returned by the hostname command)
 does not contain the domain name. In other words, instead of myhost you would use myhost.mydomain.edu. You may still use the short form if you wish (and even
 mix the two). This option is only effective when the canonical host name, as returned by the <b>getaddrinfo</b>() or <b>gethostbyname</b>() function, is a
 fully-qualified domain name. This is usually the case when the system is configured to use DNS for host name resolution.
 </p><p>If the system is configured to use the /etc/hosts file in preference to DNS, the canonical host name may not be fully-qualified. The order that
 sources are queried for hosts name resolution is usually specified in the /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/netsvc.conf, /etc/host.conf, or, in
 some cases, /etc/resolv.conf file. In the /etc/hosts file, the first host name of the entry is considered to be the canonical name;
 subsequent names are aliases that are not used by <b>sudoers</b>. For example, the following hosts file line for the machine xyzzy has the fully-qualified
 domain name as the canonical host name, and the short version as an alias.
 </p><p>192.168.1.1 xyzzy.sudo.ws xyzzy
 </p><p>If the machines hosts file entry is not formatted properly, the fqdn option will not be effective if it is queried before DNS.
 </p><p>Beware that when using DNS for host name resolution, turning on fqdn requires <b>sudoers</b> to make DNS lookups which renders <b>sudo</b> unusable
 if DNS stops working (for example if the machine is disconnected from the network). Also note that just like with the hosts file, you must use the
 canonical name as DNS knows it. That is, you may not use a host alias (<br>
 CNAME entry) due to performance issues and the fact that there is no way to get all aliases from DNS.
 </p><p>This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>ignore_dot If set, <b>sudo</b> will ignore . or  (both denoting current directory) in the PATH environment variable; the PATH itself is not modified.
 This flag is on by default.
 </p><p>ignore_local_sudoers<br>
 If set via LDAP, parsing of /etc/sudoers will be skipped. This is intended for Enterprises that wish to prevent the usage of local sudoers files so that
 only LDAP is used. This thwarts the efforts of rogue operators who would attempt to add roles to /etc/sudoers. When this option is present,
 /etc/sudoers does not even need to exist. Since this option tells <b>sudo</b> how to behave when no specific LDAP entries have been matched, this
 sudoOption is only meaningful for the cn=defaults section. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>insults If set, <b>sudo</b> will insult users when they enter an incorrect password. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>log_host If set, the host name will be logged in the (non-syslog) <b>sudo</b> log file. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>log_input If set, <b>sudo</b> will run the command in a pseudo tty and log all user input. If the standard input is not connected to the users tty,
 due to I/O redirection or because the command is part of a pipeline, that input is also captured and stored in a separate log file.
 </p><p>Input is logged to the directory specified by the iolog_dir option (<br>
 /var/log/sudo-io by default) using a unique session ID that is included in the normal <b>sudo</b> log line, prefixed with TSID=. The iolog_file
 option may be used to control the format of the session ID.
 </p><p>Note that user input may contain sensitive information such as passwords (even if they are not echoed to the screen), which will be stored in the log file
 unencrypted. In most cases, logging the command output via log_output is all that is required.
 </p><p>log_output If set, <b>sudo</b> will run the command in a pseudo tty and log all output that is sent to the screen, similar to the <b><a href=/man/1/script>script</a></b>(1) command.
 If the standard output or standard error is not connected to the users tty, due to I/O redirection or because the command is part of a pipeline, that output
 is also captured and stored in separate log files.
 </p><p>Output is logged to the directory specified by the iolog_dir option (<br>
 /var/log/sudo-io by default) using a unique session ID that is included in the normal <b>sudo</b> log line, prefixed with TSID=. The iolog_file
 option may be used to control the format of the session ID.
 </p><p>Output logs may be viewed with the <b><a href=/man/8/sudoreplay>sudoreplay</a></b>(8) utility, which can also be used to list or search the available logs.
 </p><p>log_year If set, the four-digit year will be logged in the (non-syslog) <b>sudo</b> log file. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>long_otp_prompt<br>
 When validating with a One Time Password (OTP) scheme such as <b>S/Key</b> or <b>OPIE</b>, a two-line prompt is used to make it easier to cut and paste the
 challenge to a local window. Its not as pretty as the default but some people find it more convenient. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>mail_always Send mail to the mailto user every time a users runs <b>sudo</b>. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>mail_badpass Send mail to the mailto user if the user running <b>sudo</b> does not enter the correct password. If the command the user is attempting
 to run is not permitted by sudoers and one of the mail_always, mail_no_host, mail_no_perms or mail_no_user flags are set,
 this flag will have no effect. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>mail_no_host If set, mail will be sent to the mailto user if the invoking user exists in the sudoers file, but is not allowed to run commands
 on the current host. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>mail_no_perms If set, mail will be sent to the mailto user if the invoking user is allowed to use <b>sudo</b> but the command they are trying is not
 listed in their sudoers file entry or is explicitly denied. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>mail_no_user If set, mail will be sent to the mailto user if the invoking user is not in the sudoers file. This flag is on by default.

 </p><p>noexec If set, all commands run via <b>sudo</b> will behave as if the NOEXEC tag has been set, unless overridden by a EXEC tag. See the description of
 NOEXEC and EXEC below as well as the Preventing shell escapes section at the end of this manual. This flag is off by default.

 </p><p>path_info Normally, <b>sudo</b> will tell the user when a command could not be found in their PATH environment variable. Some sites may wish to disable
 this as it could be used to gather information on the location of executables that the normal user does not have access to. The disadvantage is that if the
 executable is simply not in the users PATH, <b>sudo</b> will tell the user that they are not allowed to run it, which can be confusing. This flag is on
 by default.
 </p><p>passprompt_override<br>
 The password prompt specified by passprompt will normally only be used if the password prompt provided by systems such as PAM matches the string
 Password:. If passprompt_override is set, passprompt will always be used. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>preserve_groups<br>
 By default, <b>sudo</b> will initialize the group vector to the list of groups the target user is in. When preserve_groups is set, the users existing
 group vector is left unaltered. The real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the target user. This flag is off by default.

 </p><p>pwfeedback By default, <b>sudo</b> reads the password like most other Unix programs, by turning off echo until the user hits the return (or enter) key.
 Some users become confused by this as it appears to them that <b>sudo</b> has hung at this point. When pwfeedback is set, <b>sudo</b> will provide
 visual feedback when the user presses a key. Note that this does have a security impact as an onlooker may be able to determine the length of the password
 being entered. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>requiretty If set, <b>sudo</b> will only run when the user is logged in to a real tty. When this flag is set, <b>sudo</b> can only be run from a login
 session and not via other means such as <b><a href=/man/8/cron>cron</a></b>(8) or cgi-bin scripts. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>root_sudo If set, root is allowed to run <b>sudo</b> too. Disabling this prevents users from chaining <b>sudo</b> commands to get a root shell by doing
 something like sudo sudo /bin/sh. Note, however, that turning off root_sudo will also prevent root from running <b>sudoedit</b>. Disabling
 root_sudo provides no real additional security; it exists purely for historical reasons. This flag is on by default.
 </p><p>rootpw If set, <b>sudo</b> will prompt for the root password instead of the password of the invoking user. This flag is off by default.

 </p><p>runaspw If set, <b>sudo</b> will prompt for the password of the user defined by the runas_default option (defaults to root) instead of the password
 of the invoking user. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>set_home If enabled and <b>sudo</b> is invoked with the <b>-s</b> option the HOME environment variable will be set to the home directory of the target user
 (which is root unless the <b>-u</b> option is used). This effectively makes the <b>-s</b> option imply <b>-H</b>. Note that HOME is already set when the the
 env_reset option is enabled, so set_home is only effective for configurations where either env_reset is disabled or HOME is present in the
 env_keep list. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>set_logname Normally, <b>sudo</b> will set the LOGNAME, USER and USERNAME environment variables to the name of the target user (usually root unless the
 <b>-u</b> option is given). However, since some programs (including the RCS revision control system) use LOGNAME to determine the real identity of the user, it
 may be desirable to change this behavior. This can be done by negating the set_logname option. Note that if the env_reset option has not been disabled,
 entries in the env_keep list will override the value of set_logname. This flag is on by default.
 </p><p>set_utmp When enabled, <b>sudo</b> will create an entry in the utmp (or utmpx) file when a pseudo-tty is allocated. A pseudo-tty is allocated by
 <b>sudo</b> when the log_input, log_output or use_pty flags are enabled. By default, the new entry will be a copy of the users existing
 utmp entry (if any), with the tty, time, type and pid fields updated. This flag is on by default.
 </p><p>setenv Allow the user to disable the env_reset option from the command line via the <b>-E</b> option. Additionally, environment variables set via
 the command line are not subject to the restrictions imposed by env_check, env_delete, or env_keep. As such, only trusted users should be
 allowed to set variables in this manner. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>shell_noargs If set and <b>sudo</b> is invoked with no arguments it acts as if the <b>-s</b> option had been given. That is, it runs a shell as root (the
 shell is determined by the SHELL environment variable if it is set, falling back on the shell listed in the invoking users /etc/passwd entry if not). This
 flag is off by default.
 </p><p>stay_setuid Normally, when <b>sudo</b> executes a command the real and effective UIDs are set to the target user (root by default). This option changes
 that behavior such that the real UID is left as the invoking users UID. In other words, this makes <b>sudo</b> act as a setuid wrapper. This can be useful on
 systems that disable some potentially dangerous functionality when a program is run setuid. This option is only effective on systems that support either the
 <b><a href=/man/2/setreuid>setreuid</a></b>(2) or <b><a href=/man/2/setresuid>setresuid</a></b>(2) system call. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>targetpw If set, <b>sudo</b> will prompt for the password of the user specified by the <b>-u</b> option (defaults to root) instead of the password of the
 invoking user. In addition, the time stamp file name will include the target users name. Note that this flag precludes the use of a uid not listed in the
 passwd database as an argument to the <b>-u</b> option. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>tty_tickets If set, users must authenticate on a per-tty basis. With this flag enabled, <b>sudo</b> will use a file named for the tty the user is logged in
 on in the users time stamp directory. If disabled, the time stamp of the directory is used instead. This flag is on by default.
 </p><p>umask_override If set, <b>sudo</b> will set the umask as specified by sudoers without modification. This makes it possible to specify a more
 permissive umask in sudoers than the users own umask and matches historical behavior. If umask_override is not set, <b>sudo</b> will set the
 umask to be the union of the users umask and what is specified in sudoers. This flag is off by default. If set, <b>sudo</b> will run the command
 in a pseudo-pty even if no I/O logging is being gone. A malicious program run under <b>sudo</b> could conceivably fork a background process that retains to the
 users terminal device after the main program has finished executing. Use of this option will make that impossible. This flag is off by default.

 </p><p>utmp_runas If set, <b>sudo</b> will store the name of the runas user when updating the utmp (or utmpx) file. By default, <b>sudo</b> stores the name of the
 invoking user. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p>visiblepw By default, <b>sudo</b> will refuse to run if the user must enter a password but it is not possible to disable echo on the terminal. If the
 visiblepw flag is set, <b>sudo</b> will prompt for a password even when it would be visible on the screen. This makes it possible to run things like
 ssh somehost sudo ls since by default, <b><a href=/man/1/ssh>ssh</a></b>(1) does not allocate a tty when running a command. This flag is off by default.
 </p><p><b>Integers</b>:
 </p><p>closefrom Before it executes a command, <b>sudo</b> will close all open file descriptors other than standard input, standard output and standard error (ie:
 file descriptors 0-2). The closefrom option can be used to specify a different file descriptor at which to start closing. The default is 3.

 </p><p>passwd_tries The number of tries a user gets to enter his/her password before <b>sudo</b> logs the failure and exits. The default is 3.
 </p><p><b>Integers that can be used in a boolean context</b>:
 </p><p>loglinelen Number of characters per line for the file log. This value is used to decide when to wrap lines for nicer log files. This has no effect on the
 syslog log file, only the file log. The default is 80 (use 0 or negate the option to disable word wrap).
 </p><p>passwd_timeout Number of minutes before the <b>sudo</b> password prompt times out, or 0 for no timeout. The timeout may include a fractional component if
 minute granularity is insufficient, for example 2.5. The default is 5.
 </p><p>timestamp_timeout<br>
 Number of minutes that can elapse before <b>sudo</b> will ask for a passwd again. The timeout may include a fractional component if minute granularity is
 insufficient, for example 2.5. The default is 5. Set this to 0 to always prompt for a password. If set to a value less than 0 the users time stamp will never
 expire. This can be used to allow users to create or delete their own time stamps via sudo -v and sudo -k respectively.
 </p><p>umask Umask to use when running the command. Negate this option or set it to 0777 to preserve the users umask. The actual umask that is used will be the
 union of the users umask and the value of the umask option, which defaults to 0022. This guarantees that <b>sudo</b> never lowers the umask when
 running a command. Note: on systems that use PAM, the default PAM configuration may specify its own umask which will override the value set in sudoers.

 </p><p><b>Strings</b>:
 </p><p>badpass_message<br>
 Message that is displayed if a user enters an incorrect password. The default is Sorry, try again. unless insults are enabled.
 </p><p>editor A colon (:) separated list of editors allowed to be used with <b>visudo</b>. <b>visudo</b> will choose the editor that matches the users EDITOR
 environment variable if possible, or the first editor in the list that exists and is executable. The default is /usr/local/bin/vi.
 </p><p>iolog_dir The top-level directory to use when constructing the path name for the input/output log directory. Only used if the log_input or
 log_output options are enabled or when the LOG_INPUT or LOG_OUTPUT tags are present for a command. The session sequence number, if any, is stored in the
 directory. The default is /var/log/sudo-io.
 </p><p>The following percent (%) escape sequences are supported:
 </p><p>%{seq}<br>
 expanded to a monotonically increasing base-36 sequence number, such as 0100A5, where every two digits are used to form a new directory, e.g. 01/00/A5

 </p><p>%{user}<br>
 expanded to the invoking users login name
 </p><p>%{group}<br>
 expanded to the name of the invoking users real group ID
 </p><p>%{runas_user}<br>
 expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (e.g. root)
 </p><p>%{runas_group}<br>
 expanded to the group name of the user the command will be run as (e.g. wheel)
 </p><p>%{hostname}<br>
 expanded to the local host name without the domain name
 </p><p>%{command}<br>
 expanded to the base name of the command being run
 </p><p>In addition, any escape sequences supported by the systems <b><a href=/man/3/strftime>strftime</a></b>(3) function will be expanded.
 </p><p>To include a literal % character, the string %% should be used.
 </p><p>iolog_file The path name, relative to iolog_dir, in which to store input/output logs when the log_input or log_output options are
 enabled or when the LOG_INPUT or LOG_OUTPUT tags are present for a command. Note that iolog_file may contain directory components. The default is
 %{seq}.
 </p><p>See the iolog_dir option above for a list of supported percent (%) escape sequences.
 </p><p>In addition to the escape sequences, path names that end in six or more Xs will have the Xs replaced with a unique combination of digits and letters,
 similar to the <b><a href=/man/3/mktemp>mktemp</a></b>(3) function.
 </p><p>mailsub Subject of the mail sent to the mailto user. The escape %h will expand to the host name of the machine. Default is *** SECURITY
 information for %h ***.
 </p><p>noexec_file This option is no longer supported. The path to the noexec file should now be set in the /etc/sudo.conf file.
 </p><p>passprompt The default prompt to use when asking for a password; can be overridden via the <b>-p</b> option or the SUDO_PROMPT environment variable. The
 following percent (%) escape sequences are supported:
 </p><p>%H expanded to the local host name including the domain name (only if the machines host name is fully qualified or the fqdn option is set)

 </p><p>%h expanded to the local host name without the domain name
 </p><p>%p expanded to the user whose password is being asked for (respects the rootpw, targetpw and runaspw flags in sudoers)

 </p><p>%U expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (defaults to root)
 </p><p>%u expanded to the invoking users login name
 </p><p>%% two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a single % character
 </p><p>The default value is [sudo] password for %p:. The default SELinux role to use when constructing a new security context to run the command. The default
 role may be overridden on a per-command basis in sudoers or via command line options. This option is only available when <b>sudo</b> is built with
 SELinux support.
 </p><p>runas_default The default user to run commands as if the <b>-u</b> option is not specified on the command line. This defaults to root.
 </p><p>syslog_badpri Syslog priority to use when user authenticates unsuccessfully. Defaults to alert.
 </p><p>The following syslog priorities are supported: <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>debug</b>, <b>emerg</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>notice</b>, and
 <b>warning</b>.
 </p><p>syslog_goodpri Syslog priority to use when user authenticates successfully. Defaults to notice.
 </p><p>See syslog_badpri for the list of supported syslog priorities.
 </p><p>sudoers_locale Locale to use when parsing the sudoers file, logging commands, and sending email. Note that changing the locale may affect how sudoers is
 interpreted. Defaults to C.
 </p><p>timestampdir The directory in which <b>sudo</b> stores its time stamp files. The default is /var/db/sudo.
 </p><p>timestampowner The owner of the time stamp directory and the time stamps stored therein. The default is root.
 </p><p>type The default SELinux type to use when constructing a new security context to run the command. The default type may be overridden on a per-command basis
 in sudoers or via command line options. This option is only available when <b>sudo</b> is built with SELinux support.
 </p><p><b>Strings that can be used in a boolean context</b>:
 </p><p>env_file The env_file option specifies the fully qualified path to a file containing variables to be set in the environment of the program being
 run. Entries in this file should either be of the form VARIABLE=value or export VARIABLE=value. The value may optionally be surrounded by single or
 double quotes. Variables in this file are subject to other <b>sudo</b> environment settings such as env_keep and env_check.
 </p><p>exempt_group<br>
 Users in this group are exempt from password and PATH requirements. The group name specified should not include a % prefix. This is not set by default.

 </p><p>group_plugin<br>
 A string containing a sudoers group plugin with optional arguments. This can be used to implement support for the nonunix_group syntax described
 earlier. The string should consist of the plugin path, either fully-qualified or relative to the /usr/libexec directory, followed by any configuration
 arguments the plugin requires. These arguments (if any) will be passed to the plugins initialization function. If arguments are present, the string must be
 enclosed in double quotes ().
 </p><p>For example, given /etc/sudo-group, a group file in Unix group format, the sample group plugin can be used:
 </p><p>Defaults group_plugin=sample_group.so /etc/sudo-group
 </p><p>For more information see <b>sudo_plugin</b>(5).
 </p>
 always<br>
 Always lecture the user.
 <p>never<br>
 Never lecture the user.
 </p><p>once Only lecture the user the first time they run <b>sudo</b>.
 </p><p>If no value is specified, a value of once is implied. Negating the option results in a value of never being used. The default value is
 once.
 </p><p>lecture_file<br>
 Path to a file containing an alternate <b>sudo</b> lecture that will be used in place of the standard lecture if the named file exists. By default, <b>sudo</b>
 uses a built-in lecture.
 </p><p>listpw This option controls when a password will be required when a user runs <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-l</b> option. It has the following possible values:

 </p><p>all All the users sudoers entries for the current host must have the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid entering a password.
 </p><p>always The user must always enter a password to use the <b>-l</b> option.
 </p><p>any At least one of the users sudoers entries for the current host must have the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid entering a password.

 </p><p>never The user need never enter a password to use the <b>-l</b> option.
 </p><p>If no value is specified, a value of any is implied. Negating the option results in a value of never being used. The default value is
 any.
 </p><p>logfile Path to the <b>sudo</b> log file (not the syslog log file). Setting a path turns on logging to a file; negating this option turns it off. By
 default, <b>sudo</b> logs via syslog.
 </p><p>mailerflags<br>
 Flags to use when invoking mailer. Defaults to <b>-t</b>.
 </p><p>mailerpath Path to mail program used to send warning mail. Defaults to the path to sendmail found at configure time.
 </p><p>mailfrom Address to use for the from address when sending warning and error mail. The address should be enclosed in double quotes () to protect
 against <b>sudo</b> interpreting the @ sign. Defaults to the name of the user running <b>sudo</b>.
 </p><p>mailto Address to send warning and error mail to. The address should be enclosed in double quotes () to protect against <b>sudo</b> interpreting the @
 sign. Defaults to root.
 </p><p>secure_path<br>
 Path used for every command run from <b>sudo</b>. If you dont trust the people running <b>sudo</b> to have a sane PATH environment variable you may want to
 use this. Another use is if you want to have the root path be separate from the user path. Users in the group specified by the exempt_group
 option are not affected by secure_path. This option is not set by default.
 </p><p>syslog Syslog facility if syslog is being used for logging (negate to disable syslog logging). Defaults to authpriv.
 </p><p>The following syslog facilities are supported: <b>authpriv</b> (if your OS supports it), <b>auth</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>local0</b>,
 <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>, <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b>, and <b>local7</b>.
 </p><p>verifypw This option controls when a password will be required when a user runs <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-v</b> option. It has the following possible
 values:
 </p><p>all All the users sudoers entries for the current host must have the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid entering a password.
 </p><p>always<br>
 The user must always enter a password to use the <b>-v</b> option.
 </p><p>any At least one of the users sudoers entries for the current host must have the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid entering a password.

 </p><p>never<br>
 The user need never enter a password to use the <b>-v</b> option.
 </p><p>If no value is specified, a value of all is implied. Negating the option results in a value of never being used. The default value is
 all.
 </p><p><b>Lists that can be used in a boolean context</b>:
 </p><p>env_check Environment variables to be removed from the users environment if the variables value contains % or / characters. This can be used to guard
 against printf-style format vulnerabilities in poorly-written programs. The argument may be a double-quoted, space-separated list or a single value without
 double-quotes. The list can be replaced, added to, deleted from, or disabled by using the =, +=, -=, and ! operators respectively. Regardless of whether the
 env_reset option is enabled or disabled, variables specified by env_check will be preserved in the environment if they pass the aforementioned check. The
 default list of environment variables to check is displayed when <b>sudo</b> is run by root with the <b>-V</b> option.
 </p><p>env_delete Environment variables to be removed from the users environment when the env_reset option is not in effect. The argument may be a
 double-quoted, space-separated list or a single value without double-quotes. The list can be replaced, added to, deleted from, or disabled by using the =, +=,
 -=, and ! operators respectively. The default list of environment variables to remove is displayed when <b>sudo</b> is run by root with the <b>-V</b> option.
 Note that many operating systems will remove potentially dangerous variables from the environment of any setuid process (such as <b>sudo</b>).

 </p><p>env_keep Environment variables to be preserved in the users environment when the env_reset option is in effect. This allows fine-grained control
 over the environment <b>sudo</b>-spawned processes will receive. The argument may be a double-quoted, space-separated list or a single value without
 double-quotes. The list can be replaced, added to, deleted from, or disabled by using the =, +=, -=, and ! operators respectively. The default list of
 variables to keep is displayed when <b>sudo</b> is run by root with the <b>-V</b> option.
 </p><h2>Log Format</h2>

 <br><br><b>sudoers</b> can log events using either <b><a href=/man/3/syslog rel=nofollow>syslog</a></b>(3) or a simple log file. In each case the log format is almost identical.<br><br><b>Accepted command log entries</b><br><br>Commands that sudo runs are logged using the following format (split into multiple lines for readability):date hostname progname: username : TTY=ttyname ; PWD=cwd ; \
     USER=runasuser ; GROUP=runasgroup ; TSID=logid ; \
     ENV=env_vars COMMAND=commandviasyslog(3), the actual date format is controlled by thesyslog daemon.  If logging to a file and the hostname The name of the host <b>sudo</b> was run on. This field is only present when logging via <b><a href=/man/3/syslog rel=nofollow>syslog</a></b>(3).
 <p>progname The name of the program, usually sudo or sudoedit. This field is only present when logging via <b><a href=/man/3/syslog rel=nofollow>syslog</a></b>(3).
 </p><p>username The login name of the user who ran <b>sudo</b>.
 </p><p>ttyname The short name of the terminal (e.g. console, tty01, or pts/0) <b>sudo</b> was run on, or unknown if there was no terminal present.

 </p><p>cwd The current working directory that <b>sudo</b> was run in.
 </p><p>runasuser The user the command was run as.
 </p><p>runasgroup The group the command was run as if one was specified on the command line.
 </p><p>logid An I/O log identifier that can be used to replay the commands output. This is only present when the log_input or log_output option is
 enabled.
 </p><p>env_vars A list of environment variables specified on the command line, if specified.
 </p><p>command The actual command that was executed.
 </p><p>Messages are logged using the locale specified by sudoers_locale, which defaults to the C locale.
 </p><p><b>Denied command log entries</b><br>
 If the user is not allowed to run the command, the reason for the denial will follow the user name. Possible reasons include:
 </p><p>user NOT in sudoers<br>
 The user is not listed in the sudoers file.
 </p><p>user NOT authorized on host<br>
 The user is listed in the sudoers file but is not allowed to run commands on the host.
 </p><p>command not allowed<br>
 The user is listed in the sudoers file for the host but they are not allowed to run the specified command.
 </p><p>3 incorrect password attempts<br>
 The user failed to enter their password after 3 tries. The actual number of tries will vary based on the number of failed attempts and the value of the
 passwd_tries option.
 </p><p>a password is required<b><br>
 sudo</b>s <b>-n</b> option was specified but a password was required.
 </p><p>sorry, you are not allowed to set the following environment variables<br>
 The user specified environment variables on the command line that were not allowed by sudoers.
 </p><p><b>Error log entries</b><br>
 If an error occurs, <b>sudoers</b> will log a message and, in most cases, send a message to the administrator via email. Possible errors include:

 </p><p>parse error in /etc/sudoers near line N<b><br>
 sudoers</b> encountered an error when parsing the specified file. In some cases, the actual error may be one line above or below the line number listed,
 depending on the type of error.
 </p><p>problem with defaults entries<br>
 The sudoers file contains one or more unknown Defaults settings. This does not prevent <b>sudo</b> from running, but the sudoers file should be
 checked using <b>visudo</b>.
 </p><p>timestamp owner (username): No such user<br>
 The time stamp directory owner, as specified by the timestampowner setting, could not be found in the password database.
 </p><p>unable to open/read /etc/sudoers<br>
 The sudoers file could not be opened for reading. This can happen when the sudoers file is located on a remote file system that maps user ID 0 to
 a different value. Normally, <b>sudoers</b> tries to open sudoers using group permissions to avoid this problem. Consider changing the ownership of
 /etc/sudoers by adding an option like sudoers_uid=N (where N is the user ID that owns the sudoers file) to the <b>sudoers</b> plugin line
 in the /etc/sudo.conf file.
 </p><p>unable to stat /etc/sudoers<br>
 The /etc/sudoers file is missing.
 </p><p>/etc/sudoers is not a regular file<br>
 The /etc/sudoers file exists but is not a regular file or symbolic link.
 </p><p>/etc/sudoers is owned by uid N, should be 0<br>
 The sudoers file has the wrong owner. If you wish to change the sudoers file owner, please add sudoers_uid=N (where N is the user ID that
 owns the sudoers file) to the <b>sudoers</b> plugin line in the /etc/sudo.conf file.
 </p><p>/etc/sudoers is world writable<br>
 The permissions on the sudoers file allow all users to write to it. The sudoers file must not be world-writable, the default file mode is 0440
 (readable by owner and group, writable by none). The default mode may be changed via the sudoers_mode option to the <b>sudoers</b> plugin line in the

 </p><p><b>Notes on logging via syslog</b><br>
 By default, sudoers logs messages via <b><a href=/man/3/syslog rel=nofollow>syslog</a></b>(3). The date, hostname, and progname fields are added by the syslog daemon, not
 sudoers itself. As such, they may vary in format on different systems.
 </p><p>On most systems, <b><a href=/man/3/syslog rel=nofollow>syslog</a></b>(3) has a relatively small log buffer. To prevent the command line arguments from being truncated, <b>sudoers</b> will split up log
 messages that are larger than 960 characters (not including the date, hostname, and the string sudo). When a message is split, additional parts will
 include the string (command continued) after the user name and before the continued command line arguments.
 </p><p><b>Notes on logging to a file</b><br>
 If the logfile option is set, sudoers will log to a local file, such as /var/log/sudo. When logging to a file, sudoers uses a
 format similar to <b><a href=/man/3/syslog rel=nofollow>syslog</a></b>(3), with a few important differences:
 </p><p>1. The progname and hostname fields are not present.
 </p><p>2. If the log_year option is enabled, the date will also include the year.
 </p><p>3. Lines that are longer than loglinelen characters (80 by default) are word-wrapped and continued on the next line with a four character indent.
 This makes entries easier to read for a human being, but makes it more difficult to use <b><a href=/man/1/grep>grep</a></b>(1) on the log files. If the loglinelen option is set to 0
 (or negated with a !), word wrap will be disabled.
 </p><p><b>SUDO.CONF</b>
 </p>

 <br><br>The /etc/sudo.conf file determines which plugins the <b>sudo</b> front end will load. If no /etc/sudo.conf file is present, or it contains no
 Plugin lines, <b>sudo</b> will use the sudoers security policy and I/O logging, which corresponds to the following /etc/sudo.conf file.#
 # Default /etc/sudo.conf file
 #
 # Format:
 #   Plugin plugin_name plugin_path plugin_options ...
 #   Path askpass /path/to/askpass
 #   Path noexec /path/to/sudo_noexec.so
 #   Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@warn
 #   Set disable_coredump true
 #
 # The plugin_path is relative to /usr/libexec unless
 #   fully qualified.
 # The plugin_name corresponds to a global symbol in the plugin
 #   that contains the plugin interface structure.
 # The plugin_options are optional.
 #
 Plugin policy_plugin Plugin options

 <br><br>Starting with <b>sudo</b> 1.8.5, it is possible to pass options to the sudoers plugin. Options may be listed after the path to the plugin (i.e. after
 sudoers.so); multiple options should be space-separated. For example:Plugin sudoers_policy The sudoers_file option can be used to override the default path to the sudoers file.
 <p>sudoers_uid=uid<br>
 The sudoers_uid option can be used to override the default owner of the sudoers file. It should be specified as a numeric user ID.
 </p><p>sudoers_gid=gid<br>
 The sudoers_gid option can be used to override the default group of the sudoers file. It should be specified as a numeric group ID.
 </p><p>sudoers_mode=mode<br>
 The sudoers_mode option can be used to override the default file mode for the sudoers file. It should be specified as an octal value.

 </p><p><b>Debug flags</b><br>
 Versions 1.8.4 and higher of the sudoers plugin supports a debugging framework that can help track down what the plugin is doing internally if there is
 a problem. This can be configured in the /etc/sudo.conf file as described in <b><a href=/man/8/sudo>sudo</a></b>(8).
 </p><p>The sudoers plugin uses the same debug flag format as the <b>sudo</b> front-end: subsystem@priority.
 </p><p>The priorities used by sudoers, in order of decreasing severity, are: crit, err, warn, notice, diag, info,
 trace and debug. Each priority, when specified, also includes all priorities higher than it. For example, a priority of notice would
 include debug messages logged at notice and higher.

 <br><br><b>Limitations of the</b> ! operatorALL using the ! operator. A user can trivially circumvent this by copying the desired
 command to a different name and then executing that. For example:

 name, or use a shell escape from an editor or other program. Therefore, these kind of restrictions should be considered advisory at best (and reinforced by
 policy).<br><br>In general, if a user has sudo <b>ALL</b> there is nothing to prevent them from creating their own program that gives them a root shell (or making their own
 copy of a shell) regardless of any ! elements in the user specification.<br><br><b>Security implications of</b> fast_glob<br><br>If the fast_glob option is in use, it is not possible to reliably negate commands where the path name includes globbing (aka wildcard) characters.
 This is because the C librarys <b><a href=/man/3/fnmatch rel=nofollow>fnmatch</a></b>(3) function cannot resolve relative paths. While this is typically only an inconvenience for rules that grant
 privileges, it can result in a security issue for rules that subtract or revoke privileges.<br><br>For example, given the following sudoers entry:john    ALL = /usr/bin/passwd [a-zA-Z0-9]*, /usr/bin/chsh [a-zA-Z0-9]*,\
               /usr/bin/chfn [a-zA-Z0-9]*, !/usr/bin/* rootjohn can still run /usr/bin/passwd root if <br><br><b>Preventing shell escapes</b><br><br>Once <b>sudo</b> executes a program, that program is free to do whatever it pleases, including run other programs. This can be a security issue since it is
 not uncommon for a program to allow shell escapes, which lets a user bypass <b>sudo</b>s access control and logging. Common programs that permit shell escapes
 include shells (obviously), editors, paginators, mail and terminal programs.<br><br>There are two basic approaches to this problem:restrictAvoid giving users access to commands that allow the user to run arbitrary commands. Many editors have a restricted mode where shell escapes are disabled,
 though <b>sudoedit</b> is a better solution to running editors via <b>sudo</b>. Due to the large number of programs that offer shell escapes, restricting users
 to the set of programs that do not is often unworkable.
 <p>noexec Many systems that support shared libraries have the ability to override default library functions by pointing an environment variable (usually
 LD_PRELOAD) to an alternate shared library. On such systems, <b>sudo</b>s noexec functionality can be used to prevent a program run by <b>sudo</b> from
 executing any other programs. Note, however, that this applies only to native dynamically-linked executables. Statically-linked executables and foreign
 executables running under binary emulation are not affected.
 </p><p>The noexec feature is known to work on SunOS, Solaris, *BSD, Linux, IRIX, Tru64 UNIX, MacOS X, HP-UX 11.x and AIX 5.3 and above. It should be
 supported on most operating systems that support the LD_PRELOAD environment variable. Check your operating systems manual pages for the dynamic linker
 (usually ld.so, ld.so.1, dyld, dld.sl, rld, or loader) to see if LD_PRELOAD is supported.
 </p><p>To enable noexec for a command, use the NOEXEC tag as documented in the User Specification section above. Here is that example again:

 </p><p>aaron shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi
 </p><p>This allows user <b>aaron</b> to run /usr/bin/more and /usr/bin/vi with noexec enabled. This will prevent those two commands from
 executing other commands (such as a shell). If you are unsure whether or not your system is capable of supporting noexec you can always just try it out
 and check whether shell escapes work when noexec is enabled.
 </p><p>Note that restricting shell escapes is not a panacea. Programs running as root are still capable of many potentially hazardous operations (such as changing
 or overwriting files) that could lead to unintended privilege escalation. In the specific case of an editor, a safer approach is to give the user permission to
 run <b>sudoedit</b>.

 <br><br>The <b>virsh</b> program is the main interface for managing virsh guest domains. The program can be used to create, pause, and shutdown domains. It can also
 be used to list current domains. Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is
 free software available under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Virtualization of the Linux Operating System means the ability to run
 multiple instances of Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aims at
 providing a long term stable C API . It currently supports Xen, QEmu, KVM , LXC , OpenVZ, VirtualBox and VMware
 ESX .<br><br>The basic structure of most virsh usage is:virsh<br><br>The <b>virsh</b> program can be used either to run one COMMAND by giving the command and its arguments on the shell command line, or a
 COMMAND_STRING which is a single shell argument consisting of multiple COMMAND actions and their arguments joined
 with whitespace, and separated by semicolons between commands. Within COMMAND_STRING , virsh understands the same single, double, and
 backslash escapes as the shell, although you must add another layer of shell escaping in creating the single shell argument. If no command is given in the
 command line, <b>virsh</b> will then start a minimal interpreter waiting for your commands, and the <b>quit</b> command will then exit the program.<br><br>The <b>virsh</b> program understands the following OPTIONS .
 -h, --help
 Ignore all other arguments, and behave as if the <b>help</b> command were given instead.-v, --version[=short]
 Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library virsh is coming from-V, --version=long
 Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library virsh is coming from and which options and driver are compiled in.-c, --connect Connect to the specified URI , as if by the <b>connect</b> command, instead of the default connection.-d, --debug Enable debug messages at integer LEVEL and above. LEVEL can range from 0 to 4 (default). See the documentation
 of <b>VIRSH_DEBUG</b> environment variable below for the description of each LEVEL .-l, --log Output logging details to FILE .-q, --quiet
 Avoid extra informational messages.-r, --readonly
 Make the initial connection read-only, as if by the --readonly option of the <b>connect</b> command.-t, --timing

 <br><br>Most <b>virsh</b> operations rely upon the libvirt library being able to connect to an already running libvirtd service. This can usually be done using the
 command <b>service libvirtd start</b>.<br><br>Most <b>virsh</b> commands require root privileges to run due to the communications channels used to talk to the hypervisor. Running as non root will return
 an error.<br><br>Most <b>virsh</b> commands act synchronously, except maybe shutdown, setvcpus and setmem. In those cases the fact that the <b>virsh</b> program returned,
 may not mean the action is complete and you must poll periodically to detect that the guest completed the operation.<br><br><b>virsh</b> strives for backward compatibility. Although the <b>help</b> command only lists the preferred usage of a command, if an older version of
 <b>virsh</b> supported an alternate spelling of a command or option (such as --tunnelled instead of --tunneled), then scripts using that older
 spelling will continue to work.<br><br>Several <b>virsh</b> commands take an optionally scaled integer; if no scale is provided, then the default is listed in the command (for historical reasons,
 some commands default to bytes, while other commands default to kibibytes). The following case-insensitive suffixes can be used to select a specfic scale: b,

 </p>cd [Will change current directory to directory. The default directory for the <b>cd</b> command is the home directory or, if there is no
 HOME variable in the environment, the root directory.
 <p>This command is only available in interactive mode.
 </p>pwd

 <br><br>Will print the current directory.connect (Re)-Connect to the hypervisor. When the shell is first started, this is automatically run with the URI parameter requested by the
 -c option on the command line. The URI parameter specifies how to connect to the hypervisor. The documentation page at
 &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/uri.html>http://libvirt.org/uri.html</a>&gt; list the values supported, but the most common are:xen:///this is used to connect to the local Xen hypervisor, this is the defaultqemu:///systemconnect locally as root to the daemon supervising QEmu and KVM domainsqemu:///sessionconnect locally as a normal user to his own set of QEmu and KVM domainslxc:///connect to a local linux containerFor remote access see the documentation page at &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/uri.html>http://libvirt.org/uri.html</a>&gt; on how to make URIs. The --readonly option allows for read-only
 connectionuri

 <br><br>Prints the hypervisor canonical URI , can be useful in shell mode.hostname
 Print the hypervisor hostname.sysinfo
 Print the XML representation of the hypervisor sysinfo, if available.nodeinfo
 Returns basic information about the node, like number and type of CPU , and size of the physical memory. The output corresponds to
 virNodeInfo structure. Specifically, the  CPU <b>socket</b>(s) field means number of CPU sockets per NUMA cell.nodecpustats [Returns cpu stats of the node. If cpu is specified, this will prints specified cpu statistics only. If --percent is specified, this will
 prints percentage of each kind of cpu statistics during 1 second.nodememstats [Returns memory stats of the node. If cell is specified, this will prints specified cell statistics only.nodesuspend [Puts the node (host machine) into a system-wide sleep state such as Suspend-to-RAM, Suspend-to-Disk or Hybrid-Suspend and sets up a Real-Time-Clock
 interrupt to fire (to wake up the node) after a time delay specified by the duration parameter. The duration time should be at least 60 seconds.node-memory-tune [Allows you to display or set the node memory parameters. shm-pages-to-scan can be used to set the number of pages to scan before the shared memory
 service goes to sleep; shm-sleep-millisecs can be used to set the number of millisecs the shared memory service should sleep before next scan;
 shm-merge-across-nodes specifies if pages from different numa nodes can be merged. When set to 0, only pages which physically reside in the memory area
 of same NUMA node can be merged. When set to 1, pages from all nodes can be merged. Default to 1.capabilities
 Print an XML document describing the capabilities of the hypervisor we are currently connected to. This includes a section on the host
 capabilities in terms of CPU and features, and a set of description for each kind of guest which can be virtualized. For a more complete
 description see: &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/formatcaps.html>http://libvirt.org/formatcaps.html</a>&gt; The XML also show the NUMA topology information if available.inject-nmi Inject NMI to the guest.list [Prints information about existing domains. If no options are specified it prints out information about running domains.
 <p>An example format for the list is as follows:
 </p><p><b>virsh</b> list Id Name State ---------------------------------------------------- 0 Domain-0 running 2 fedora paused
 </p><p>Name is the name of the domain. ID the domain numeric id. State is the run state (see below).
 </p><p><b>STATES</b>
 </p><p>The State field lists 8 states for a domain, and which ones the current domain is in.
 </p><b>running</b>The domain is currently running on a CPU<b>idle</b>The domain is idle, and not running or runnable. This can be caused because the domain is waiting on IO (a traditional wait state) or has
 gone to sleep because there was nothing else for it to do.<b>paused</b>The domain has been paused, usually occurring through the administrator running <b>virsh suspend</b>. When in a paused state the domain will still consume
 allocated resources like memory, but will not be eligible for scheduling by the hypervisor.<b>shutdown</b>The domain is in the process of shutting down, i.e. the guest operating system has been notified and should be in the process of stopping its operations
 gracefully.<b>shut off</b>The domain is not running. Usually this indicates the domain has been shut down completely, or has not been started.<b>crashed</b>The domain has crashed, which is always a violent ending. Usually this state can only occur if the domain has been configured not to restart on
 crash.<b>dying</b>The domain is in process of dying, but hasnt completely shutdown or crashed.<b>pmsuspended</b>The domain has been suspended by guest power management, e.g. entered into s3 state.Normally only active domains are listed. To list inactive domains specify --inactive or --all to list both active and inactive domains.

 <p>To further filter the list of domains you may specify one or more of filtering flags supported by the <b>list</b> command. These flags are grouped by
 function. Specifying one or more flags from a group enables the filter group. Note that some combinations of flags may yield no results. Supported filtering
 flags and groups:
 </p><b>Persistence</b>Flag --persistent is used to include persistent domains in the returned list. To include transient domains specify --transient.<b>Existence of managed save image</b>To list domains having a managed save image specify flag --with-managed-save. For domains that dont have a managed save image specify
 --without-managed-save.<b>Domain state</b>The following filter flags select a domain by its state: --state-running for running domains, --state-paused for paused domains,
 --state-shutoff for turned off domains and --state-other for all other states as a fallback.<b>Autostarting domains</b>To list autostarting domains use the flag --autostart. To list domains with this feature disabled use --no-autostart.<b>Snapshot existence</b>Domains that have snapshot images can be listed using flag --with-snapshot, domains without a snapshot --without-snapshot.When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of API calls with an inherent race, where a domain might not be listed
 or might appear more than once if it changed state between calls while the list was being collected. Newer servers do not have this problem.

 <p>If --managed-save is specified, then domains that have managed save state (only possible if they are in the <b>shut off</b> state, so you need to
 specify --inactive or --all to actually list them) will instead show as <b>saved</b> in the listing. This flag is usable only with the default
 --table output. Note that this flag does not filter the list of domains.
 </p><p>If --name is specified, domain names are printed instead of the table formatted one per line. If --uuid is specified domains
 UUID s are printed instead of names. Flag --table specifies that the legacy table-formatted output should be used. This is the default.
 All of these are mutually exclusive.
 </p><p>If --title is specified, then the short domain description (title) is printed in an extra column. This flag is usable only with the default
 --table output.
 </p><p>Example:
 </p><p><b>virsh</b> list --title Id Name State Title -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 Domain-0 running Mailserver 1 2
 fedora paused
 </p>freecell [{ [cellno | Prints the available amount of memory on the machine or within a NUMA cell. The freecell command can provide one of three different displays
 of available memory on the machine depending on the options specified. With no options, it displays the total free memory on the machine. With the --all
 option, it displays the free memory in each cell and the total free memory on the machine. Finally, with a numeric argument or with --cellno plus a cell number
 it will display the free memory for the specified cell only.cpu-baseline Compute baseline CPU which will be supported by all host CPUs given in &lt;file&gt;. The list of host CPUs is built by extracting all
 &lt;cpu&gt; elements from the &lt;file&gt;. Thus, the &lt;file&gt; can contain either a set of &lt;cpu&gt; elements separated by new lines or even a set of
 complete &lt;capabilities&gt; elements printed by <b>capabilities</b> command.cpu-compare Compare CPU definition from XML &lt;file&gt; with host CPU . The XML &lt;file&gt; may contain
 either host or guest CPU definition. The host CPU definition is the &lt;cpu&gt; element and its contents as printed by
 <b>capabilities</b> command. The guest CPU definition is the &lt;cpu&gt; element and its contents from domain XML definition. For
 more information on guest CPU definition see: &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU>http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU</a>&gt;echo [Echo back each arg, separated by space. If --shell is specified, then the output will be single-quoted where needed, so that it is suitable
 for reuse in a shell context. If --xml is specified, then the output will be escaped for use in XML .

 <br><br>The following commands manipulate domains directly, as stated previously most commands take domain as the first parameter. The domain can be
 specified as a short integer, a name or a full UUID .
 autostart [Configure a domain to be automatically started at boot.
 <p>The option --disable disables autostarting.
 </p>console Connect the virtual serial console for the guest. The optional devname parameter refers to the device alias of an alternate console, serial or
 parallel device configured for the guest. If omitted, the primary console will be opened.
 <p>If the flag --safe is specified, the connection is only attempted if the driver supports safe console handling. This flag specifies that the server
 has to ensure exclusive access to console devices. Optionally the --force flag may be specified, requesting to disconnect any existing sessions, such as
 in a case of a broken connection.
 </p>create Create a domain from an XML &lt;file&gt;. An easy way to create the XML &lt;file&gt; is to use the <b>dumpxml</b> command to
 obtain the definition of a pre-existing guest. The domain will be paused if the --paused option is used and supported by the driver; otherwise it will
 be running. If --console is requested, attach to the console after creation. If --autodestroy is requested, then the guest will be automatically
 destroyed when virsh closes its connection to libvirt, or otherwise exits.
 <p><b>Example</b>
 </p>virsh dumpxml &lt;domain&gt; &gt; domain.xml
 vi domain.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
 virsh create domain.xmldefine Define a domain from an XML &lt;file&gt;. The domain definition is registered but not started. If domain is already running, the changes will
 take effect on the next boot.desc Show or modify description and title of a domain. These values are user fields that allow to store arbitrary textual data to allow easy identification of
 domains. Title should be short, although its not enforced.
 <p>Flags --live or --config select whether this command works on live or persistent definitions of the domain. If both --live and
 --config are specified, the --config option takes precedence on getting the current description and both live configuration and config are
 updated while setting the description. --current is exclusive and implied if none of these was specified.
 </p><p>Flag --edit specifies that an editor with the contents of current description or title should be opened and the contents saved back afterwards.

 </p><p>Flag --title selects operation on the title field instead of description.
 </p><p>If neither of --edit and --new-desc are specified the note or description is displayed instead of being modified.
 </p>destroy Immediately terminate the domain domain. This doesnt give the domain OS any chance to react, and its the equivalent of ripping the
 power cord out on a physical machine. In most cases you will want to use the <b>shutdown</b> command instead. However, this does not delete any storage volumes
 used by the guest, and if the domain is persistent, it can be restarted later.
 <p>If domain is transient, then the metadata of any snapshots will be lost once the guest stops running, but the snapshot contents still exist, and a
 new domain with the same name and UUID can restore the snapshot metadata with <b>snapshot-create</b>.
 </p><p>If --graceful is specified, dont resort to extreme measures (e.g. SIGKILL ) when the guest doesnt stop after a reasonable timeout;
 return an error instead.
 </p>domblkstat Get device block stats for a running domain. A block-device corresponds to a unique target name (&lt;target dev=name/&gt;) or source file
 (&lt;source file=name/&gt;) for one of the disk devices attached to domain (see also <b>domblklist</b> for listing these names).
 <p>Use --human for a more human readable output.
 </p><p>Availability of these fields depends on hypervisor. Unsupported fields are missing from the output. Other fields may appear if communicating with a newer
 version of libvirtd.
 </p><p><b>Explanation of fields</b> (fields appear in the folowing order): rd_req - count of read operations rd_bytes - count of read bytes wr_req - count of write
 operations wr_bytes - count of written bytes errs - error count flush_operations - count of flush operations rd_total_times - total time read operations took
 (ns) wr_total_times - total time write operations took (ns) flush_total_times - total time flush operations took (ns) &lt;-- other fields provided by
 hypervisor --&gt;
 </p>domifstat Get network interface stats for a running domain.domif-setlink Modify link state of the domains virtual interface. Possible values for state are up and down. If --config is specified, only the persistent
 configuration of the domain is modified, for compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias of --config. interface-device can be the
 interfaces target name or the MAC address.domif-getlink Query link state of the domains virtual interface. If --config is specified, query the persistent configuration, for compatibility purposes,
 --persistent is alias of --config.
 <p>interface-device can be the interfaces target name or the MAC address.
 </p>domiftune Set or query the domains network interfaces bandwidth parameters. interface-device can be the interfaces target name (&lt;target dev=name/&gt;),
 or the MAC address.
 <p>If no --inbound or --outbound is specified, this command will query and show the bandwidth settings. Otherwise, it will set the inbound or
 outbound bandwidth. average,peak,burst is the same as in command attach-interface.
 </p><p>If --live is specified, affect a running guest. If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest. If --current is
 specified, affect the current guest state. Both --live and --current flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is
 specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.
 </p>dommemstat Get memory stats for a running domain.domblkerror Show errors on block devices. This command usually comes handy when <b>domstate</b> command says that a domain was paused due to I/O error. The
 <b>domblkerror</b> command lists all block devices in error state and the error seen on each of them.domblkinfo Get block device size info for a domain. A block-device corresponds to a unique target name (&lt;target dev=name/&gt;) or source file (&lt;source
 file=name/&gt;) for one of the disk devices attached to domain (see also <b>domblklist</b> for listing these names).domblklist Print a table showing the brief information of all block devices associated with domain. If --inactive is specified, query the block devices
 that will be used on the next boot, rather than those currently in use by a running domain. If --details is specified, disk type and device value will
 also be printed. Other contexts that require a block device name (such as domblkinfo or snapshot-create for disk snapshots) will accept either
 target or unique source names printed by this command.domiflist Print a table showing the brief information of all virtual interfaces associated with domain. If --inactive is specified, query the virtual
 interfaces that will be used on the next boot, rather than those currently in use by a running domain. Other contexts that require a MAC address
 of virtual interface (such as detach-interface or domif-setlink) will accept the MAC address printed by this command.blockcommit seconds]]
 Reduce the length of a backing image chain, by committing changes at the top of the chain (snapshot or delta files) into backing images. By default, this
 command attempts to flatten the entire chain. If base and/or top are specified as files within the backing chain, then the operation is
 constrained to committing just that portion of the chain; --shallow can be used instead of base to specify the immediate backing file of the
 resulting top image to be committed. The files being committed are rendered invalid, possibly as soon as the operation starts; using the --delete flag
 will remove these files at the successful completion of the commit operation.
 <p>By default, this command returns as soon as possible, and data for the entire disk is committed in the background; the progress of the operation can be
 checked with <b>blockjob</b>. However, if --wait is specified, then this command will block until the operation completes, or cancel the operation if
 the optional timeout in seconds elapses or SIGINT is sent (usually with Ctrl-C). Using --verbose along with
 --wait will produce periodic status updates.
 </p><p>path specifies fully-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds to a unique target name (&lt;target dev=name/&gt;) or source file (&lt;source
 file=name/&gt;) for one of the disk devices attached to domain (see also <b>domblklist</b> for listing these names). bandwidth specifies
 copying bandwidth limit in MiB/s, although for qemu, it may be non-zero only for an online domain.
 </p>blockcopy seconds] [Copy a disk backing image chain to dest. By default, this command flattens the entire chain; but if --shallow is specified, the copy shares
 the backing chain.
 <p>If --reuse-external is specified, then dest must exist and have contents identical to the resulting backing file (that is, it must start with
 contents matching the backing file disk if --shallow is used, otherwise it must start empty); this option is typically used to set up a relative
 backing file name in the destination.
 </p><p>The format of the destination is determined by the first match in the following list: if --raw is specified, it will be raw; if
 --reuse-external is specified, the existing destination is probed for a format; and in all other cases, the destination format will match the source
 format.
 </p><p>By default, the copy job runs in the background, and consists of two phases. Initially, the job must copy all data from the source, and during this phase,
 the job can only be canceled to revert back to the source disk, with no guarantees about the destination. After this phase completes, both the source and the
 destination remain mirrored until a call to <b>blockjob</b> with the --abort and --pivot flags pivots over to the copy, or a call without
 --pivot leaves the destination as a faithful copy of that point in time. However, if --wait is specified, then this command will block until the
 mirroring phase begins, or cancel the operation if the optional timeout in seconds elapses or SIGINT is sent (usually with
 Ctrl-C). Using --verbose along with --wait will produce periodic status updates. Using --pivot or --finish along with
 --wait will additionally end the job cleanly rather than leaving things in the mirroring phase. If job cancellation is triggered, --async will
 return control to the user as fast as possible, otherwise the command may continue to block a little while longer until the job is done cleaning up.

 </p><p>path specifies fully-qualified path of the disk. bandwidth specifies copying bandwidth limit in MiB/s.
 </p>blockpull seconds]
 [Populate a disk from its backing image chain. By default, this command flattens the entire chain; but if base is specified, containing the name of
 one of the backing files in the chain, then that file becomes the new backing file and only the intermediate portion of the chain is pulled. Once all requested
 data from the backing image chain has been pulled, the disk no longer depends on that portion of the backing chain.
 <p>By default, this command returns as soon as possible, and data for the entire disk is pulled in the background; the progress of the operation can be checked
 with <b>blockjob</b>. However, if --wait is specified, then this command will block until the operation completes, or cancel the operation if the
 optional timeout in seconds elapses or SIGINT is sent (usually with Ctrl-C). Using --verbose along with --wait
 will produce periodic status updates. If job cancellation is triggered, --async will return control to the user as fast as possible, otherwise the
 command may continue to block a little while longer until the job is done cleaning up.
 </p><p>path specifies fully-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds to a unique target name (&lt;target dev=name/&gt;) or source file (&lt;source
 file=name/&gt;) for one of the disk devices attached to domain (see also <b>domblklist</b> for listing these names). bandwidth specifies
 copying bandwidth limit in MiB/s.
 </p>blkdeviotune Set or query the block disk io parameters for a block device of domain. device specifies a unique target name (&lt;target dev=name/&gt;) or
 source file (&lt;source file=name/&gt;) for one of the disk devices attached to domain (see also <b>domblklist</b> for listing these names).

 <p>If no limit is specified, it will query current I/O limits setting. Otherwise, alter the limits with these flags: --total-bytes-sec specifies total
 throughput limit in bytes per second. --read-bytes-sec specifies read throughput limit in bytes per second. --write-bytes-sec specifies write
 throughput limit in bytes per second. --total-iops-sec specifies total I/O operations limit per second. --read-iops-sec specifies read I/O
 operations limit per second. --write-iops-sec specifies write I/O operations limit per second.
 </p><p>Older versions of virsh only accepted these options with underscore instead of dash, as in --total_bytes_sec.
 </p><p>Bytes and iops values are independent, but setting only one value (such as --read-bytes-sec) resets the other two in that category to unlimited. An explicit
 0 also clears any limit. A non-zero value for a given total cannot be mixed with non-zero values for read or write.
 </p><p>If --live is specified, affect a running guest. If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest. If --current is
 specified, affect the current guest state. Both --live and --current flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is
 specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.
 </p>blockjob Manage active block operations. There are three modes: --info, bandwidth, and --abort; --info is default except that
 --async or --pivot implies --abort.
 <p>path specifies fully-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds to a unique target name (&lt;target dev=name/&gt;) or source file (&lt;source
 file=name/&gt;) for one of the disk devices attached to domain (see also <b>domblklist</b> for listing these names).
 </p><p>If --abort is specified, the active job on the specified disk will be aborted. If --async is also specified, this command will return
 immediately, rather than waiting for the cancelation to complete. If --pivot is specified, this requests that an active copy job be pivoted over to the
 new copy. If --info is specified, the active job information on the specified disk will be printed. bandwidth can be used to set bandwidth limit
 for the active job.
 </p>blockresize Resize a block device of domain while the domain is running, path specifies the absolute path of the block device; it corresponds to a unique target
 name (&lt;target dev=name/&gt;) or source file (&lt;source file=name/&gt;) for one of the disk devices attached to domain (see also
 <b>domblklist</b> for listing these names).
 <p>size is a scaled integer (see <b>NOTES</b> above) which defaults to KiB (blocks of 1024 bytes) if there is no suffix. You must use a
 suffix of B to get bytes (note that for historical reasons, this differs from <b>vol-resize</b> which defaults to bytes without a suffix).
 </p>domdisplay Output a URI which can be used to connect to the graphical display of the domain via VNC , SPICE or
 RDP . If --include-password is specified, the SPICE channel password will be included in the URI .domhostname Returns the hostname of a domain, if the hypervisor makes it available.dominfo Returns basic information about the domain.domuuid Convert a domain name or id to domain UUIDdomid Convert a domain name (or UUID ) to a domain iddomjobabort Abort the currently running domain job.domjobinfo Returns information about jobs running on a domain.domname Convert a domain Id (or UUID ) to domain namedomstate Returns state about a domain. --reason tells virsh to also print reason for the state.domcontrol Returns state of an interface to VMM used to control a domain. For states other than ok or error the command also prints number of
 seconds elapsed since the control interface entered its current state.domxml-from-native Convert the file config in the native guest configuration format named by format to a domain XML format. For
 QEMU/KVM hypervisor, the format argument must be <b>qemu-argv</b>. For Xen hypervisor, the format argument may be <b>xen-xm</b> or
 <b>xen-sxpr</b>.domxml-to-native Convert the file xml in domain XML format to the native guest configuration format named by format. For QEMU/KVM
 hypervisor, the format argument must be <b>qemu-argv</b>. For Xen hypervisor, the format argument may be <b>xen-xm</b> or
 <b>xen-sxpr</b>.dump Dumps the core of a domain to a file for analysis. If --live is specified, the domain continues to run until the core dump is complete, rather than
 pausing up front. If --crash is specified, the domain is halted with a crashed status, rather than merely left in a paused state. If --reset is
 specified, the domain is reset after successful dump. Note, these three switches are mutually exclusive. If --bypass-cache is specified, the save will
 avoid the file system cache, although this may slow down the operation. If --memory-only is specified, the file is elf file, and will only include
 domains memory and cpu common register value. It is very useful if the domain uses host devices directly.
 <p>The progress may be monitored using <b>domjobinfo</b> virsh command and canceled with <b>domjobabort</b> command (sent by another virsh instance). Another
 option is to send SIGINT (usually with Ctrl-C) to the virsh process running <b>dump</b> command. --verbose displays the
 progress of dump.
 </p><p>NOTE: Some hypervisors may require the user to manually ensure proper permissions on file and path specified by argument
 corefilepath.
 </p>dumpxml Output the domain information as an XML dump to stdout, this format can be used by the <b>create</b> command. Additional options affecting
 the XML dump may be used. --inactive tells virsh to dump domain configuration that will be used on next start of the domain as opposed to
 the current domain configuration. Using --security-info will also include security sensitive information in the XML dump.
 --update-cpu updates domain CPU requirements according to host CPU . With --migratable one can request an
 XML that is suitable for migrations, i.e., compatible with older libvirt releases and possibly amended with internal run-time options. This
 option may automatically enable other options (--update-cpu, --security-info, ...) as necessary.edit Edit the XML configuration file for a domain, which will affect the next boot of the guest.
 <p>This is equivalent to:
 </p>virsh dumpxml --inactive --security-info domain &gt; domain.xml
 vi domain.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
 virsh define domain.xmlexcept that it does some error checking.
 <p>The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and defaults to vi.
 </p>managedsave Save and destroy (stop) a running domain, so it can be restarted from the same state at a later time. When the virsh <b>start</b> command is next run for
 the domain, it will automatically be started from this saved state. If --bypass-cache is specified, the save will avoid the file system cache, although
 this may slow down the operation.
 <p>The progress may be monitored using <b>domjobinfo</b> virsh command and canceled with <b>domjobabort</b> command (sent by another virsh instance). Another
 option is to send SIGINT (usually with Ctrl-C) to the virsh process running <b>managedsave</b> command. --verbose displays the
 progress of save.
 </p><p>Normally, starting a managed save will decide between running or paused based on the state the domain was in when the save was done; passing either the
 --running or --paused flag will allow overriding which state the <b>start</b> should use.
 </p><p>The <b>dominfo</b> command can be used to query whether a domain currently has any managed save image.
 </p>managedsave-remove Remove the <b>managedsave</b> state file for a domain, if it exists. This ensures the domain will do a full boot the next time it is started.maxvcpus [Provide the maximum number of virtual CPUs supported for a guest VM on this connection. If provided, the type parameter must be a
 valid type attribute for the &lt;domain&gt; element of XML .cpu-stats Provide cpu statistics information of a domain. The domain should be running. Default it shows stats for all CPUs, and a total. Use --total for only
 the total stats, start for only the per-cpu stats of the CPUs from start, count for only count CPUs stats.migrate [seconds] [file]
 Migrate domain to another host. Add --live for live migration; --p2p for peer-2-peer migration; --direct for direct migration; or
 --tunnelled for tunnelled migration. --persistent leaves the domain persistent on destination host, --undefinesource undefines the domain
 on the source host, and --suspend leaves the domain paused on the destination host. --copy-storage-all indicates migration with non-shared
 storage with full disk copy, --copy-storage-inc indicates migration with non-shared storage with incremental copy (same base image shared between source
 and destination). In both cases the disk images have to exist on destination host, the --copy-storage-... options only tell libvirt to transfer data
 from the images on source host to the images found at the same place on the destination host. --change-protection enforces that no incompatible
 configuration changes will be made to the domain while the migration is underway; this flag is implicitly enabled when supported by the hypervisor, but can be
 explicitly used to reject the migration if the hypervisor lacks change protection support. --verbose displays the progress of migration.

 <p><b>Note</b>: Individual hypervisors usually do not support all possible types of migration. For example, QEMU does not support direct
 migration.
 </p><p>In some cases libvirt may refuse to migrate the domain because doing so may lead to potential problems such as data corruption, and thus the migration is
 considered unsafe. For QEMU domain, this may happen if the domain uses disks without explicitly setting cache mode to none. Migrating such
 domains is unsafe unless the disk images are stored on coherent clustered filesystem, such as GFS2 or GPFS . If you are sure the
 migration is safe or you just do not care, use --unsafe to force the migration.
 </p><p>The desturi is the connection URI of the destination host, and migrateuri is the migration URI , which usually
 can be omitted. dname is used for renaming the domain to new name during migration, which also usually can be omitted. Likewise, --xml
 <b>file</b> is usually omitted, but can be used to supply an alternative XML file for use on the destination to supply a larger set of changes
 to any host-specific portions of the domain XML , such as accounting for naming differences between source and destination in accessing
 underlying storage.
 </p><p>--timeout <b>seconds</b> forces guest to suspend when live migration exceeds that many seconds, and then the migration will complete offline. It can
 only be used with --live.
 </p><p>Running migration can be canceled by interrupting virsh (usually using Ctrl-C) or by <b>domjobabort</b> command sent from another virsh instance.

 </p><p><b>Note</b>: The desturi parameter for normal migration and peer2peer migration has different semantics:
 </p>• normal migration: the desturi is an address of the target host as seen from the client machine.

 <p>• peer2peer migration: the desturi is an address of the target host as seen from the source machine.
 </p>migrate-setmaxdowntime Set maximum tolerable downtime for a domain which is being live-migrated to another host. The downtime is a number of milliseconds the guest is
 allowed to be down at the end of live migration.migrate-setspeed Set the maximum migration bandwidth (in Mbps) for a domain which is being migrated to another host.migrate-getspeed Get the maximum migration bandwidth (in Mbps) for a domain.numatune mode] [nodeset] [[Set or get a domains numa parameters, corresponding to the &lt;numatune&gt; element of domain XML . Without flags, the current settings are
 displayed.
 <p>mode can be one of strict, interleave and preferred. For a running domain, the mode cant be changed, and the nodeset can be changed only if
 the domain was started with a mode of strict.
 </p><p>nodeset is a list of numa nodes used by the host for running the domain. Its syntax is a comma separated list, with - for ranges and ^ for
 excluding a node.
 </p><p>If --live is specified, set scheduler information of a running guest. If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest. If
 --current is specified, affect the current guest state.
 </p>reboot Reboot a domain. This acts just as if the domain had the <b>reboot</b> command run from the console. The command returns as soon as it has executed the
 reboot action, which may be significantly before the domain actually reboots.
 <p>The exact behavior of a domain when it reboots is set by the on_reboot parameter in the domains XML definition.
 </p><p>By default the hypervisor will try to pick a suitable shutdown method. To specify an alternative method, the --mode parameter can specify
 acpi or agent.
 </p>reset Reset a domain immediately without any guest shutdown. <b>reset</b> emulates the power reset button on a machine, where all guest hardware sees the
 RST line set and reinitializes internal state.
 <p><b>Note</b>: Reset without any guest OS shutdown risks data loss.
 </p>restore file] [{Restores a domain from a <b>virsh save</b> state file. See save for more info.
 <p>If --bypass-cache is specified, the restore will avoid the file system cache, although this may slow down the operation.
 </p><p>--xml <b>file</b> is usually omitted, but can be used to supply an alternative XML file for use on the restored guest with changes
 only in the host-specific portions of the domain XML . For example, it can be used to account for file naming differences in underlying storage
 due to disk snapshots taken after the guest was saved.
 </p><p>Normally, restoring a saved image will use the state recorded in the save image to decide between running or paused; passing either the --running or
 --paused flag will allow overriding which state the domain should be started in.
 </p><p><b>Note</b>: To avoid corrupting file system contents within the domain, you should not reuse the saved state file for a second <b>restore</b> unless you
 have also reverted all storage volumes back to the same contents as when the state file was created.
 </p>save file] [{Saves a running domain ( RAM , but not disk state) to a state file so that it can be restored later. Once saved, the domain will no longer be
 running on the system, thus the memory allocated for the domain will be free for other domains to use. <b>virsh restore</b> restores from this state file. If
 --bypass-cache is specified, the save will avoid the file system cache, although this may slow down the operation.

 </p>screenshot screenID]
 Takes a screenshot of a current domain console and stores it into a file. Optionally, if hypervisor supports more displays for a domain, screenID
 allows to specify which screen will be captured. It is the sequential number of screen. In case of multiple graphics cards, heads are enumerated before
 devices, e.g. having two graphics cards, both with four heads, screen ID 5 addresses the second head on the second card.send-key codeset] [holdtime] Parse the keycode sequence as keystrokes to send to domain. Each keycode can either be a numeric value or a symbolic name from the

 </p><p>The --storage flag takes a parameter <b>volumes</b>, which is a comma separated list of volume target names or source paths of storage volumes to be
 removed along with the undefined domain. Volumes can be undefined and thus removed only on inactive domains. Volume deletion is only attempted after the domain
 is undefined; if not all of the requested volumes could be deleted, the error message indicates what still remains behind. If a volume path is not found in the
 domain definition, its treated as if the volume was successfully deleted. (See <b>domblklist</b> for list of target names associated to a domain). Example:

 </p>vcpucount Print information about the virtual cpu counts of the given domain. If no flags are specified, all possible counts are listed in a table; otherwise,
 the output is limited to just the numeric value requested. For historical reasons, the table lists the label current on the rows that can be queried in
 isolation via the --active flag, rather than relating to the --current flag.
 <p>--maximum requests information on the maximum cap of vcpus that a domain can add via <b>setvcpus</b>, while --active shows the current usage;
 these two flags cannot both be specified. --config requires a persistent domain and requests information regarding the next time the domain will be
 booted, --live requires a running domain and lists current values, and --current queries according to the current state of the domain
 (corresponding to --live if running, or --config if inactive); these three flags are mutually exclusive. Thus, this command always takes exactly
 zero or two flags.
 </p>vcpuinfo Returns basic information about the domain virtual CPUs, like the number of vCPUs, the running time, the affinity to physical processors.vcpupin Query or change the pinning of domain VCPUs to host physical CPUs. To pin a single vcpu, specify cpulist; otherwise, you can query one
 vcpu or omit vcpu to list all at once.
 <p>cpulist is a list of physical CPU numbers. Its syntax is a comma separated list and a special markup using - and ^ (ex. 0-4,
 0-3,^2) can also be allowed. The - denotes the range and the ^ denotes exclusive. If you want to reset vcpupin setting, that is, to pin vcpu all physical
 cpus, simply specify r as a cpulist. If --live is specified, affect a running guest. If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a
 persistent guest. If --current is specified, affect the current guest state. Both --live and --config flags may be given if cpulist
 is present, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.
 </p><p><b>Note</b>: The expression is sequentially evaluated, so 0-15,^8 is identical to 9-14,0-7,15 but not identical to ^8,0-15.
 </p>emulatorpin Query or change the pinning of domains emulator threads to host physical CPUs.
 <p>See <b>vcpupin</b> for cpulist.
 </p><p>If --live is specified, affect a running guest. If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest. If --current is
 specified, affect the current guest state. Both --live and --config flags may be given if cpulist is present, but --current is

 <br><br>The following commands manipulate devices associated to domains. The domain can be specified as a short integer, a name or a full UUID
 . To better understand the values allowed as options for the command reading the documentation at &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html>http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html</a>&gt; on the format of
 the device sections to get the most accurate set of accepted values.
 attach-device Attach a device to the domain, using a device definition in an XML file using a device definition element such as &lt;disk&gt; or
 &lt;interface&gt; as the top-level element. See the documentation at &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDevices>http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDevices</a>&gt; to learn about libvirt
 XML format for a device. If --config is specified the command alters the persistent domain configuration with the device attach taking
 effect the next time libvirt starts the domain. For compatibility purposes, --persistent is an alias of --config. For cdrom and floppy devices,
 this command only replaces the media within an existing device; consider using <b>update-device</b> for this usage. For passthrough host devices, see also
 <b>nodedev-detach</b>, needed if the device does not use managed mode.attach-disk Attach a new disk device to the domain. source is path for the files and devices. target controls the bus or device under which the disk is
 exposed to the guest OS . It indicates the logical device name. driver can be file, tap or phy for the Xen
 hypervisor depending on the kind of access; or qemu for the QEMU emulator. Further details to the driver can be passed using
 subdriver. For Xen subdriver can be aio, while for QEMU subdriver should match the format of the disk source, such as
 raw or qcow2. Hypervisor default will be used if subdriver is not specified. However, the default may not be correct, esp. for
 QEMU as for security reasons it is configured not to detect disk formats. type can indicate lun, cdrom or floppy as
 alternative to the disk default, although this use only replaces the media within the existing virtual cdrom or floppy device; consider using
 <b>update-device</b> for this usage instead. mode can specify the two specific mode readonly or shareable. --config indicates the
 changes will affect the next boot of the domain, for compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias of --config. sourcetype can indicate
 the type of source (block|file) cache can be one of default, none, writethrough, writeback, directsync or unsafe. serial is the
 serial of disk device. shareable indicates the disk device is shareable between domains. rawio indicates the disk needs rawio capability.
 address is the address of disk device in the form of pci:domain.bus.slot.function, scsi:controller.bus.unit or ide:controller.bus.unit.
 multifunction indicates specified pci address is a multifunction pci device address.attach-interface Attach a new network interface to the domain. type can be either network to indicate a physical network device or bridge to indicate a
 bridge to a device. source indicates the source device. target allows to indicate the target device in the guest. Names starting with vnet are
 considered as auto-generated an hence blanked out. mac allows to specify the MAC address of the network interface. script allows
 to specify a path to a script handling a bridge instead of the default one. model allows to specify the model type. --config indicates the
 changes will affect the next boot of the domain, for compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias of --config. inbound and
 outbound control the bandwidth of the interface. peak and burst are optional, so average,peak, average,,burst and average are also
 legal.
 <p><b>Note</b>: the optional target value is the name of a device to be created as the back-end on the node. If not provided a device named vnetN or vifN
 will be created automatically.
 </p>detach-device Detach a device from the domain, takes the same kind of XML descriptions as command <b>attach-device</b>. If --config is specified,
 alter persistent configuration, effect observed on next boot, for compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias of --config. For passthrough host
 devices, see also <b>nodedev-reattach</b>, needed if the device does not use managed mode.detach-disk Detach a disk device from a domain. The target is the device as seen from the domain. If --config is specified, alter persistent
 configuration, effect observed on next boot, for compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias of --config.detach-interface Detach a network interface from a domain. type can be either network to indicate a physical network device or bridge to indicate a
 bridge to a device. It is recommended to use the mac option to distinguish between the interfaces if more than one are present on the domain. If
 --config is specified, alter persistent configuration, effect observed on next boot, for compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias of
 --config.update-device Update the characteristics of a device associated with domain, based on the device definition in an XML file. If the
 --config option is used, the changes will take affect the next time libvirt starts the domain. For compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias
 of --config. The --force option can be used to force device update, e.g., to eject a CD-ROM even if it is locked/mounted in the domain. See the
 documentation at &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDevices>http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDevices</a>&gt; to learn about libvirt XML format for a device.change-media Change media of CDROM or floppy drive. path can be the fully-qualified path or the unique target name (&lt;target dev=hdc&gt;) of
 the disk device. source specifies the path of the media to be inserted or updated.
 <p>--eject indicates the media will be ejected. --insert indicates the media will be inserted. source must be specified. If the device has
 source (e.g. &lt;source file=media&gt;), and source is not specified, --update is equal to --eject. If the device has no source, and
 source is specified, --update is equal to --insert. If the device has source, and source is specified, --update behaves like
 combination of --eject and --insert. If none of --eject, --insert, and --update is specified, --update is used by
 default. The --force option can be used to force media changing. If --live is specified, alter live configuration of running guest. If
 --config is specified, alter persistent configuration, effect observed on next boot. --current can be either or both of live and
 config, depends on the hypervisors implementation. Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no
 flag is specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

 <br><br>The following commands manipulate host devices that are intended to be passed through to guest domains via &lt;hostdev&gt; elements in a domains
 &lt;devices&gt; section. A node device key is generally specified by the bus name followed by its address, using underscores between all components, such as
 pci_0000_00_02_1, usb_1_5_3, or net_eth1_00_27_13_6a_fe_00. The <b>nodedev-list</b> gives the full list of host devices that are known to libvirt, although
 this includes devices that cannot be assigned to a guest (for example, attempting to detach the PCI device that controls the hosts hard disk
 controller where the guests disk images live could cause the host system to lock up or reboot).<br><br>For more information on node device definition see: &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/formatnode.html>http://libvirt.org/formatnode.html</a>&gt;.<br><br>Passthrough devices cannot be simultaneously used by the host and its guest domains, nor by multiple active guests at once. If the &lt;hostdev&gt;
 description includes the attribute <b>managed=yes</b>, and the hypervisor driver supports it, then the device is in managed mode, and attempts to use that
 passthrough device in an active guest will automatically behave as if <b>nodedev-detach</b> (guest start, device hot-plug) and <b>nodedev-reattach</b> (guest
 stop, device hot-unplug) were called at the right points (currently, qemu does this for PCI devices, but not USB ). If a device
 is not marked as managed, then it must manually be detached before guests can use it, and manually reattached to be returned to the host. Also, if a device is
 manually detached, then the host does not regain control of the device without a matching reattach, even if the guests use the device in managed mode.
 nodedev-create Create a device on the host node that can then be assigned to virtual machines. Normally, libvirt is able to automatically determine which host nodes are
 available for use, but this allows registration of host hardware that libvirt did not automatically detect. file contains xml for a top-level
 &lt;device&gt; description of a node device.nodedev-destroy Destroy (stop) a device on the host. Note that this makes libvirt quit managing a host device, and may even make that device unusable by the rest of the
 physical host until a reboot.nodedev-detach Detach nodedev from the host, so that it can safely be used by guests via &lt;hostdev&gt; passthrough. This is reversed with <b>nodedev-reattach</b>,
 and is done automatically for managed devices. For compatibility purposes, this command can also be spelled <b>nodedev-dettach</b>.nodedev-dumpxml Dump a &lt;device&gt; XML representation for the given node device, including such information as the device name, which bus owns the device,
 the vendor and product id, and any capabilities of the device usable by libvirt (such as whether device reset is supported).nodedev-list List all of the devices available on the node that are known by libvirt. cap is used to filter the list by capability types, the types must be
 separated by comma, e.g. --cap pci,scsi, valid capability types include system, pci, usb_device, usb, net, scsi_host, scsi_target, scsi,
 storage. If --tree is used, the output is formatted in a tree representing parents of each node. cap and --tree are mutually exclusive.
 =item <b>nodedev-reattach</b> nodedev
 <p>Declare that nodedev is no longer in use by any guests, and that the host can resume normal use of the device. This is done automatically for devices
 in managed mode, but must be done explicitly to match any explicit <b>nodedev-detach</b>.
 </p>nodedev-reset Trigger a device reset for nodedev, useful prior to transferring a node device between guest passthrough or the host. Libvirt will often do this
 action implicitly when required, but this command allows an explicit reset when needed.

 <br><br>The following commands manipulate networks. Libvirt has the capability to define virtual networks which can then be used by domains and linked to actual

 for virtual networks are similar to the ones used for domains, but the way to name a virtual network is either by its name or UUID .
 net-autostart Configure a virtual network to be automatically started at boot. The --disable option disable autostarting.net-create Create a virtual network from an XML file, see the documentation at &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html>http://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html</a>&gt; to get a description
 of the XML network format used by libvirt.net-define Define a virtual network from an XML file, the network is just defined but not instantiated.net-destroy Destroy (stop) a given virtual network specified by its name or UUID . This takes effect immediately.net-dumpxml Output the virtual network information as an XML dump to stdout. If --inactive is specified, then physical functions are not expanded
 into their associated virtual functions.net-edit Edit the XML configuration file for a network.
 <p>This is equivalent to:
 </p>virsh net-dumpxml --inactive network &gt; network.xml
 vi network.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
 virsh net-define network.xmlexcept that it does some error checking.
 <p>The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and defaults to vi.
 </p>net-info Returns basic information about the network object.net-list [Returns the list of active networks, if --all is specified this will also include defined but inactive networks, if --inactive is specified
 only the inactive ones will be listed. You may also want to filter the returned networks by --persistent to list the persitent ones, --transient
 to list the transient ones, --autostart to list the ones with autostart enabled, and --no-autostart to list the ones with autostart disabled.

 <p>NOTE: When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of API calls with an inherent race, where a pool
 might not be listed or might appear more than once if it changed state between calls while the list was being collected. Newer servers do not have this
 problem.
 </p>net-name Convert a network UUID to network name.net-start Start a (previously defined) inactive network.net-undefine Undefine the configuration for an inactive network.net-uuid Convert a network name to network UUID .net-update Update the given section of an existing network definition, with the changes optionally taking effect immediately, without needing to destroy and re-start
 the network.
 <p>command is one of add-first, add-last, add (a synonym for add-last), delete, or modify.
 </p><p>section is one of bridge, domain, ip, ip-dhcp-host, ip-dhcp-range, forward, forward-interface, forward-pf, portgroup, dns-host,
 dns-txt, or dns-srv, each section being named by a concatenation of the xml element hierarchy leading to the element being changed. For example,
 ip-dhcp-host will change a &lt;host&gt; element that is contained inside a &lt;dhcp&gt; element inside an &lt;ip&gt; element of the network.

 </p><p>xml is either the text of a complete xml element of the type being changed (e.g. &lt;host mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 ip=1.2.3.4/&gt;, or the name of
 a file that contains a complete xml element. Disambiguation is done by looking at the first character of the provided text - if the first character is &lt;,
 it is xml text, if the first character is not &lt;, it is the name of a file that contains the xml text to be used.
 </p><p>The --parent-index option is used to specify which of several parent elements the requested element is in (0-based). For example, a dhcp &lt;host&gt;
 element could be in any one of multiple &lt;ip&gt; elements in the network; if a parent-index isnt provided, the most appropriate &lt;ip&gt; element will be
 selected (usually the only one that already has a &lt;dhcp&gt; element), but if --parent-index is given, that particular instance of &lt;ip&gt; will get
 the modification.
 </p><p>If --live is specified, affect a running network. If --config is specified, affect the next startup of a persistent network. If
 --current is specified, affect the current network state. Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive.
 Not specifying any flag is the same as specifying --current.

 ambiguity, and you must resort to a name instead).
 iface-bridge Create a bridge device named bridge, and attach the existing network device interface to the new bridge. The new bridge defaults to starting
 immediately, with STP enabled and a delay of 0; these settings can be altered with --no-stp, --no-start, and an integer number of
 seconds for delay. All IP address configuration of interface will be moved to the new bridge device.

 configuration from the bridge device to the underlying device. The underlying interface is restarted unless --no-start is present; this flag is present
 for symmetry, but generally not recommended.
 <p>See also <b>iface-bridge</b> for creating a bridge.
 </p>iface-undefine Undefine the configuration for an inactive host interface.iface-begin
 Create a snapshot of current host interface settings, which can later be committed (iface-commit) or restored (iface-rollback). If a snapshot
 already exists, then this command will fail until the previous snapshot has been committed or restored. Undefined behavior results if any external changes are
 made to host interfaces outside of the libvirt API between the beginning of a snapshot and its eventual commit or rollback.iface-commit
 Declare all changes since the last iface-begin as working, and delete the rollback point. If no interface snapshot has already been started, then
 this command will fail.iface-rollback
 Revert all host interface settings back to the state recorded in the last iface-begin. If no interface snapshot has already been started, then this

 Normally, capacity is the new size, but if --delta is present, then it is added to the existing size. Attempts to shrink the volume will fail
 unless --shrink is present; capacity cannot be negative unless --shrink is provided, but a negative sign is not necessary. capacity
 is a scaled integer (see <b>NOTES</b> above), which defaults to bytes if there is no suffix. This command is only safe for storage volumes not
 in use by an active guest; see also <b>blockresize</b> for live resizing.

 <br><br>The following commands manipulate secrets (e.g. passwords, passphrases and encryption keys). Libvirt can store secrets independently from their use, and
 other objects (e.g. volumes or domains) can refer to the secrets for encryption or possibly other uses. Secrets are identified using an UUID .

 "},{"id": 18314,"commandid" : 2431,"title": "Snapshot Commmands","page": "

 <br><br>The following commands manipulate domain snapshots. Snapshots take the disk, memory, and device state of a domain at a point-of-time, and save it for future
 use. They have many uses, from saving a clean copy of an OS image to saving a domains state before a potentially destructive operation.
 Snapshots are identified with a unique name. See &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/formatsnapshot.html>http://libvirt.org/formatsnapshot.html</a>&gt; for documentation of the XML format used to
 represent properties of snapshots.
 snapshot-create Create a snapshot for domain domain with the properties specified in xmlfile. Normally, the only properties settable for a domain snapshot are
 the &lt;name&gt; and &lt;description&gt; elements, as well as &lt;disks&gt; if --disk-only is given; the rest of the fields are ignored, and
 automatically filled in by libvirt. If xmlfile is completely omitted, then libvirt will choose a value for all fields. The new snapshot will become
 current, as listed by <b>snapshot-current</b>.
 <p>If --halt is specified, the domain will be left in an inactive state after the snapshot is created.
 </p><p>If --disk-only is specified, the snapshot will only include disk state rather than the usual system checkpoint with vm state. Disk snapshots are
 faster than full system checkpoints, but reverting to a disk snapshot may require fsck or journal replays, since it is like the disk state at the point when
 the power cord is abruptly pulled; and mixing --halt and --disk-only loses any data that was not flushed to disk at the time.
 </p><p>If --redefine is specified, then all XML elements produced by <b>snapshot-dumpxml</b> are valid; this can be used to migrate snapshot
 hierarchy from one machine to another, to recreate hierarchy for the case of a transient domain that goes away and is later recreated with the same name and
 UUID , or to make slight alterations in the snapshot metadata (such as host-specific aspects of the domain XML embedded in the
 snapshot). When this flag is supplied, the xmlfile argument is mandatory, and the domains current snapshot will not be altered unless the
 --current flag is also given.
 </p><p>If --no-metadata is specified, then the snapshot data is created, but any metadata is immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not treat the
 snapshot as current, and cannot revert to the snapshot unless --redefine is later used to teach libvirt about the metadata again).
 </p><p>If --reuse-external is specified, and the snapshot XML requests an external snapshot with a destination of an existing file, then the
 destination must exist, and is reused; otherwise, a snapshot is refused to avoid losing contents of the existing files.
 </p><p>If --quiesce is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent to freeze and unfreeze domains mounted file systems. However, if domain has no guest
 agent, snapshot creation will fail. Currently, this requires --disk-only to be passed as well.
 </p><p>If --atomic is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot either succeeds, or fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support this. If
 this flag is not specified, then some hypervisors may fail after partially performing the action, and <b>dumpxml</b> must be used to see whether any partial
 changes occurred.
 </p><p>If --live is specified, libvirt takes the snapshot while the guest is running. This increases the size of the memory image of the external
 checkpoint. This is currently supported only for external checkpoints.
 </p><p>Existence of snapshot metadata will prevent attempts to <b>undefine</b> a persistent domain. However, for transient domains, snapshot metadata is silently
 lost when the domain quits running (whether by command such as <b>destroy</b> or by internal guest action).
 </p>snapshot-create-as memspec]] [diskspec]...
 Create a snapshot for domain domain with the given &lt;name&gt; and &lt;description&gt;; if either value is omitted, libvirt will choose a value. If
 --print-xml is specified, then XML appropriate for snapshot-create is output, rather than actually creating a snapshot. Otherwise,
 if --halt is specified, the domain will be left in an inactive state after the snapshot is created, and if --disk-only is specified, the snapshot
 will not include vm state.
 <p>The --memspec option can be used to control whether a checkpoint is internal or external. The --memspec flag is mandatory, followed by a
 <b>memspec</b> of the form <b>[file=]name[,snapshot=type]</b>, where type can be <b>none</b>, <b>internal</b>, or <b>external</b>. To include a literal comma
 in <b>file=name</b>, escape it with a second comma.
 </p><p>The --diskspec option can be used to control how --disk-only and external checkpoints create external files. This option can occur multiple
 times, according to the number of &lt;disk&gt; elements in the domain xml. Each &lt;diskspec&gt; is in the form
 <b>disk[,snapshot=type][,driver=type][,file=name]</b>. To include a literal comma in <b>disk</b> or in <b>file=name</b>, escape it with a second comma. A
 literal --diskspec must preceed each <b>diskspec</b> unless all three of domain, name, and description are also present. For
 example, a diskspec of vda,snapshot=external,file=/path/to,,new results in the following XML: &lt;disk name=vda snapshot=external&gt;
 &lt;source file=/path/to,new/&gt; &lt;/disk&gt;
 </p><p>If --reuse-external is specified, and the domain XML or diskspec option requests an external snapshot with a destination of an
 existing file, then the destination must exist, and is reused; otherwise, a snapshot is refused to avoid losing contents of the existing files.

 </p><p>If --quiesce is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent to freeze and unfreeze domains mounted file systems. However, if domain has no guest
 agent, snapshot creation will fail. Currently, this requires --disk-only to be passed as well.
 </p><p>If --no-metadata is specified, then the snapshot data is created, but any metadata is immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not treat the
 snapshot as current, and cannot revert to the snapshot unless <b>snapshot-create</b> is later used to teach libvirt about the metadata again). This flag is
 incompatible with --print-xml.
 </p><p>If --atomic is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot either succeeds, or fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support this. If
 this flag is not specified, then some hypervisors may fail after partially performing the action, and <b>dumpxml</b> must be used to see whether any partial
 changes occurred.
 </p><p>If --live is specified, libvirt takes the snapshot while the guest is running. This increases the size of the memory image of the external
 checkpoint. This is currently supported only for external checkpoints.
 </p>snapshot-current Without snapshotname, this will output the snapshot XML for the domains current snapshot (if any). If --name is specified,
 just the current snapshot name instead of the full xml. Otherwise, using --security-info will also include security sensitive information in the
 XML .
 <p>With snapshotname, this is a request to make the existing named snapshot become the current snapshot, without reverting the domain.
 </p>snapshot-edit Edit the XML configuration file for snapshotname of a domain. If both snapshotname and --current are specified, also
 force the edited snapshot to become the current snapshot. If snapshotname is omitted, then --current must be supplied, to edit the current
 snapshot.
 <p>This is equivalent to:
 </p>virsh snapshot-dumpxml dom name &gt; snapshot.xml
 vi snapshot.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
 virsh snapshot-create dom snapshot.xml --redefine [--current]except that it does some error checking.
 <p>The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and defaults to vi.
 </p><p>If --rename is specified, then the edits can change the snapshot name. If --clone is specified, then changing the snapshot name will create a
 clone of the snapshot metadata. If neither is specified, then the edits must not change the snapshot name. Note that changing a snapshot name must be done with
 care, since the contents of some snapshots, such as internal snapshots within a single qcow2 file, are accessible only from the original name.
 </p>snapshot-info Output basic information about a named &lt;snapshot&gt;, or the current snapshot with --current.snapshot-list snapshot | List all of the available snapshots for the given domain, defaulting to show columns for the snapshot name, creation time, and domain state.

 <p>If --parent is specified, add a column to the output table giving the name of the parent of each snapshot. If --roots is specified, the list
 will be filtered to just snapshots that have no parents. If --tree is specified, the output will be in a tree format, listing just snapshot names. These
 three options are mutually exclusive.
 </p><p>If --from is provided, filter the list to snapshots which are children of the given <b>snapshot</b>; or if --current is provided, start at the
 current snapshot. When used in isolation or with --parent, the list is limited to direct children unless --descendants is also present. When used
 with --tree, the use of --descendants is implied. This option is not compatible with --roots. Note that the starting point of
 --from or --current is not included in the list unless the --tree option is also present.
 </p><p>If --leaves is specified, the list will be filtered to just snapshots that have no children. Likewise, if --no-leaves is specified, the list
 will be filtered to just snapshots with children. (Note that omitting both options does no filtering, while providing both options will either produce the same
 list or error out depending on whether the server recognizes the flags). Filtering options are not compatible with --tree.
 </p><p>If --metadata is specified, the list will be filtered to just snapshots that involve libvirt metadata, and thus would prevent <b>undefine</b> of a
 persistent domain, or be lost on <b>destroy</b> of a transient domain. Likewise, if --no-metadata is specified, the list will be filtered to just
 snapshots that exist without the need for libvirt metadata.
 </p><p>If --inactive is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that were taken when the domain was shut off. If --active is specified, the
 list will be filtered to snapshots that were taken when the domain was running, and where the snapshot includes the memory state to revert to that running
 state. If --disk-only is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that were taken when the domain was running, but where the snapshot includes
 only disk state.
 </p><p>If --internal is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that use internal storage of existing disk images. If --external is
 specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that use external files for disk images or memory state.
 </p>snapshot-dumpxml Output the snapshot XML for the domains snapshot named snapshot. Using --security-info will also include security sensitive
 information. Use <b>snapshot-current</b> to easily access the XML of the current snapshot.snapshot-parent Output the name of the parent snapshot, if any, for the given snapshot, or for the current snapshot with --current.snapshot-revert Revert the given domain to the snapshot specified by snapshot, or to the current snapshot with --current. Be aware that this is a destructive
 action; any changes in the domain since the last snapshot was taken will be lost. Also note that the state of the domain after snapshot-revert is complete will
 be the state of the domain at the time the original snapshot was taken.
 <p>Normally, reverting to a snapshot leaves the domain in the state it was at the time the snapshot was created, except that a disk snapshot with no vm state
 leaves the domain in an inactive state. Passing either the --running or --paused flag will perform additional state changes (such as booting an
 inactive domain, or pausing a running domain). Since transient domains cannot be inactive, it is required to use one of these flags when reverting to a disk
 snapshot of a transient domain.
 </p><p>There are two cases where a snapshot revert involves extra risk, which requires the use of --force to proceed. One is the case of a snapshot that
 lacks full domain information for reverting configuration (such as snapshots created prior to libvirt 0.9.5); since libvirt cannot prove that the current
 configuration matches what was in use at the time of the snapshot, supplying --force assures libvirt that the snapshot is compatible with the current
 configuration (and if it is not, the domain will likely fail to run). The other is the case of reverting from a running domain to an active state where a new
 hypervisor has to be created rather than reusing the existing hypervisor, because it implies drawbacks such as breaking any existing VNC or
 Spice connections; this condition happens with an active snapshot that uses a provably incompatible configuration, as well as with an inactive snapshot that is
 combined with the --start or --pause flag.
 </p>snapshot-delete Delete the snapshot for the domain named snapshot, or the current snapshot with --current. If this snapshot has child snapshots, changes from
 this snapshot will be merged into the children. If --children is passed, then delete this snapshot and any children of this snapshot. If
 --children-only is passed, then delete any children of this snapshot, but leave this snapshot intact. These two flags are mutually exclusive.

 <p>If --metadata is specified, then only delete the snapshot metadata maintained by libvirt, while leaving the snapshot contents intact for access by
 external tools; otherwise deleting a snapshot also removes the data contents from that point in time.

 <br><br><b>virt-install</b> is a command line tool for creating new KVM , Xen, or Linux container guests using the libvirt hypervisor
 management library. See the EXAMPLES section at the end of this document to quickly get started.<br><br><b>virt-install</b> tool supports both text based &amp; graphical installations, using VNC or SDL graphics, or a text serial
 console. The guest can be configured to use one or more virtual disks, network interfaces, audio devices, physical USB or PCI
 devices, among others.<br><br>The installation media can be held locally or remotely on NFS , HTTP , FTP servers. In the latter case
 virt-install will fetch the minimal files necessary to kick off the installation process, allowing the guest to fetch the rest of the
 OS distribution as needed. PXE booting, and importing an existing disk image (thus skipping the install phase) are also
 supported.<br><br>Given suitable command line arguments, virt-install is capable of running completely unattended, with the guest kickstarting itself too. This
 allows for easy automation of guest installs. An interactive mode is also available with the --prompt option, but this will only ask for the minimum required
 options."},{"id": 18327,"commandid" : 2432,"title": "Options","page": "

 <br><br>Most options are not required. Minimum requirements are --name, --ram, guest storage (--disk, --filesystem or --nodisks), and an install option.
 <br><br>If running on a host with the Xen kernel (checks against /proc/xen)qemu:///system
 If running on a bare metal kernel as root (needed for KVM installs)qemu:///session
 If running on a bare metal kernel as non-root
 <p>It is only necessary to provide the --connect argument if this default prioritization is incorrect, eg if wanting to use QEMU
 while on a Xen kernel.
 </p>

 <br><br><b>General Options</b>
 <a href=virsh>virsh</a>(1)<br><br>CPU topology can additionally be specified with sockets, cores, and threads. If values are omitted, the rest will be autofilled prefering
 sockets over cores over threads.--cpuset=CPUSET
 <br><br>The nodeset string must use escaped-quotes if specifying any other option.--cpu MODEL[,+feature][,-feature][,match=MATCH][,vendor=VENDOR]
 <br><br>Specific CPU features can be specified in a number of ways: using one of libvirts feature policy values force, require, optional, disable,
 or forbid, or with the shorthand +feature and -feature, which equal force=feature and disable=feature respectively<br><br>Some examples:--cpu core2duo,+x2apic,disable=vmx
 Expose the core2duo CPU model, force enable x2apic, but do not expose vmx--cpu host
 Expose the host CPUs configuration to the guest. This enables the guest to take advantage of many of the host CPUs features (better performance), but may
 cause issues if migrating the guest to a host without an identical CPU .--description
 <br><br><b>Installation Method options</b>
 <br><br>With libvirt 0.9.4 or later, network URL installs work for remote connections. virt-install will download kernel/initrd to the local machine,
 and then upload the media to the remote host. This option requires the URL to be accessible by both the local and remote host.<br><br>The LOCATION can take one of the following forms:DIRECTORYPath to a local directory containing an installable distribution imagenfs:host:/path or nfs://host/path
 An NFS server location containing an installable distribution imagehttp://host/path
 An HTTP server location containing an installable distribution imageftp://host/path
 An FTP server location containing an installable distribution imageSome distro specific url samples:

 <br><br>By default, virt-install will attempt to auto detect this value from the install media (currently only supported for URL installs).
 Autodetection can be disabled with the special value none.<br><br>If the special value list is passed, virt-install will print the full list of variant values and exit. The printed format is not a stable interface,
 DO NOT PARSE IT .<br><br>If the special value none is passed, no os variant is recorded and OS autodetection is disabled.<br><br>Values for some recent OS options are:win7 : Microsoft Windows 7
 <br><br>--boot can be specified in addition to other install options (such as --location, --cdrom, etc.) or can be specified on its own. In the latter case,
 behavior is similar to the --import install option: there is no install phase, the guest is just created and launched as specified.<br><br>Some examples:--boot cdrom,fd,hd,network,menu=on
 Set the boot device priority as first cdrom, first floppy, first harddisk, network PXE boot. Additionally enable BIOS boot
 menu prompt.--boot kernel=KERNEL,initrd=INITRD,kernel_args=console=/dev/ttyS0
 Have guest permanently boot off a local kernel/initrd pair, with the specified kernel options.

 <br><br><b>Storage Configuration</b>
 path
 A path to some storage media to use, existing or not. Existing media can be a file or block device. If installing on a remote host, the existing media must
 be shared as a libvirt storage volume.
 <p>Specifying a non-existent path implies attempting to create the new storage, and will require specifyng a size value. If the base directory of the path is
 a libvirt storage pool on the host, the new storage will be created as a libvirt storage volume. For remote hosts, the base directory is required to be a
 storage pool if using this method.
 </p>pool
 An existing libvirt storage pool name to create new storage on. Requires specifying a size value.vol

 <br><br>An existing libvirt storage volume to use. This is specified as poolname/volname.Other available options:

 Disk device type. Value can be cdrom, disk, or floppy. Default is disk. If a cdrom is specified, and no install method is chosen, the cdrom is
 used as the install media.bus

 <br><br>Disk bus type. Value can be ide, scsi, usb, virtio or xen. The default is hypervisor dependent since not all hypervisors support all bus
 types.perms
 Disk permissions. Value can be rw (Read/Write), ro (Readonly), or sh (Shared Read/Write). Default is rwsize

 whether to skip fully allocating newly created storage. Value is true or false. Default is true (do not fully allocate).
 <p>The initial time taken to fully-allocate the guest virtual disk (sparse=false) will be usually by balanced by faster install times inside the guest. Thus
 use of this option is recommended to ensure consistently high performance and to avoid I/O errors in the guest should the host filesystem fill up.
 </p>cache
 The cache mode to be used. The host pagecache provides cache memory. The cache value can be none, writethrough, or writeback. writethrough provides
 read caching. writeback provides read and write caching.format
 Image format to be used if creating managed storage. For file volumes, this can be raw, qcow2, vmdk, etc. See format types in
 &lt;<a href=http://libvirt.org/storage.html>http://libvirt.org/storage.html</a>&gt; for possible values. This is often mapped to the <b>driver_type</b> value as well.
 <p>With libvirt 0.8.3 and later, this option should be specified if reusing and existing disk image, since libvirt does not autodetect storage format as it is
 a potential security issue. For example, if reusing an existing qcow2 image, you will want to specify format=qcow2, otherwise the hypervisor may not be able to
 read your disk image.
 </p>driver_name
 Driver name the hypervisor should use when accessing the specified storage. Typically does not need to be set by the user.driver_type
 Driver format/type the hypervisor should use when accessing the specified storage. Typically does not need to be set by the user.io

 <br><br>Disk IO backend. Can be either threads or native.error_policy
 How guest should react if a write error is encountered. Can be one of stop, none, or enospaceserial
 Serial number of the emulated disk device. This is used in linux guests to set /dev/disk/by-id symlinks. An example serial number might be:
 WD-WMAP9A966149See the examples section for some uses. This option deprecates <br><br>The following explicit options can be specified:type
 The type or the source directory. Valid values are mount (the default) or template for OpenVZ templates.mode
 The access mode for the source directory from the guest OS . Only used with QEMU and type=mount. Valid modes are passthrough
 (the default), mapped, or squash. See libvirt domain XML documentation for more info.source
 The directory on the host to share.target
 The mount location to use in the guest.--nodisks
 <br><br><b>Networking Configuration</b>
 Connect to a bridge device in the host called BRIDGE. Use this option if the host has static networking config &amp; the guest requires full
 outbound and inbound connectivity to/from the LAN . Also use this if live migration will be used with this guest.network=NAME
 Connect to a virtual network in the host called NAME. Virtual networks can be listed, created, deleted using the virsh command line
 tool. In an unmodified install of libvirt there is usually a virtual network with a name of default. Use a virtual network if the host
 has dynamic networking (eg NetworkManager), or using wireless. The guest will be NATed to the LAN by whichever connection is active.user
 Connect to the LAN using SLIRP . Only use this if running a QEMU guest as an unprivileged user. This provides a
 very limited form of NAT .If this option is omitted a single <br><br>Other available options are:model
 Network device model as seen by the guest. Value can be any nic model supported by the hypervisor, e.g.: e1000, rtl8139, virtio, ...mac

 <br><br>Fixed MAC address for the guest; If this parameter is omitted, or the value RANDOM is specified a suitable address will be
 randomly generated. For Xen virtual machines it is required that the first 3 pairs in the MAC address be the sequence 00:16:3e, while for
 QEMU or KVM virtual machines it must be 52:54:00.--nonetworks
 <br><br><b>Graphics Configuration</b>
 <br><br>General format of a graphical string is--graphics TYPE,opt1=arg1,opt2=arg2,...type
 The display type. This is one of:
 <p>vnc
 </p><p>Setup a virtual console in the guest and export it as a VNC server in the host. Unless the port parameter is also provided, the
 VNC server will run on the first free port number at 5900 or above. The actual VNC display allocated can be obtained using the
 vncdisplay command to virsh (or <b><a href=virt-viewer>virt-viewer</a></b>(1) can be used which handles this detail for the use).
 </p><p>sdl
 </p><p>Setup a virtual console in the guest and display an SDL window in the host to render the output. If the SDL window is closed
 the guest may be unconditionally terminated.
 </p><p>spice
 </p><p>Export the guests console using the Spice protocol. Spice allows advanced features like audio and USB device streaming, as well as improved
 graphical performance.
 </p><p>Using spice graphic type will work as if those arguments were given:
 </p>--video qxl --channel spicevmcnone
 <p>No graphical console will be allocated for the guest. Fully virtualized guests (Xen FV or QEmu/KVM) will need to have a text console
 configured on the first serial port in the guest (this can be done via the --extra-args option). Xen PV will set this up automatically. The
 command virsh console NAME  can be used to connect to the serial device.
 </p>port
 Request a permanent, statically assigned port number for the guest console. This is used by vnc and spicetlsport
 Specify the spice tlsport.listen
 Address to listen on for VNC/Spice connections. Default is typically 127.0.0.1 (localhost only), but some hypervisors allow changing this globally (for
 example, the qemu driver default can be changed in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf). Use 0.0.0.0 to allow access from other machines. This is use by vnc and
 spicekeymap
 Request that the virtual VNC console be configured to run with a specific keyboard layout. If the special value local is specified,
 virt-install will attempt to configure to use the same keymap as the local system. A value of none specifically defers to the hypervisor. Default behavior is
 hypervisor specific, but typically is the same as local. This is used by vncpassword
 Request a VNC password, required at connection time. Beware, this info may end up in virt-install log files, so dont use an important
 password. This is used by vnc and spicepasswordvalidto
 Set an expiration date for password. After the date/time has passed, all new graphical connections are denyed until a new password is set. This is used by
 vnc and spice
 <p>The format for this value is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS , for example 2011-04-01T14:30:15
 </p>--vnc
 <br><br><b>Virtualization Type options</b>

 --serial pty
 Pseudo TTY . The allocated pty will be listed in the running guests XML description.--serial dev,path=HOSTPATH
 Host device. For serial devices, this could be /dev/ttyS0. For parallel devices, this could be /dev/parport0.--serial file,path=FILENAME
 Write output to FILENAME .--serial pipe,path=PIPEPATH
 Named pipe (see <b><a href=/man/7/pipe>pipe</a></b>(7))--serial tcp,host=HOST:PORT,mode=MODE,protocol=PROTOCOL
 TCP net console. MODE is either bind (wait for connections on HOST:PORT ) or connect (send output to
 HOST:PORT ), default is connect. HOST defaults to 127.0.0.1, but PORT is required. PROTOCOL can
 be either raw or telnet (default raw). If telnet, the port acts like a telnet server or client. Some examples:
 <p>Connect to localhost, port 1234:
 </p><p>--serial tcp,host=:1234
 </p><p>Wait for connections on any address, port 4567:
 </p><p>--serial tcp,host=0.0.0.0:4567,mode=bind
 </p><p>Wait for telnet connection on localhost, port 2222. The user could then connect interactively to this console via telnet localhost 2222:

 </p><p>--serial tcp,host=:2222,mode=bind,protocol=telnet
 </p>--serial udp,host=CONNECT_HOST:PORT,bind_host=BIND_HOST:BIND_PORT
 UDP net console. HOST:PORT is the destination to send output to (default HOST is 127.0.0.1,
 PORT is required). BIND_HOST:BIND_PORT is the optional local address to bind to (default BIND_HOST is 127.0.0.1,
 but is only set if BIND_PORT is specified). Some examples:
 <p>Send output to default syslog port (may need to edit /etc/rsyslog.conf accordingly):
 </p><p>--serial udp,host=:514
 </p><p>Send output to remote host 192.168.10.20, port 4444 (this output can be read on the remote host using nc -u -l 4444):
 </p><p>--serial udp,host=192.168.10.20:4444
 </p>--serial unix,path=UNIXPATH,mode=MODE
 Unix socket, see <b><a href=/man/7/unix>unix</a></b>(7). MODE has similar behavior and defaults as --serial tcp,mode=MODE--channel
 <br><br>Some of the types of character device redirection are:--channel SOURCE ,target_type=guestfwd,target_address=HOST:PORT
 Communication channel using QEMU usermode networking stack. The guest can connect to the channel using the specified HOST:PORT
 combination.--channel SOURCE ,target_type=virtio[,name=NAME]
 Communication channel using virtio serial (requires 2.6.34 or later host and guest). Each instance of a virtio --channel line is exposed in the guest as
 /dev/vport0p1, /dev/vport0p2, etc. NAME is optional metadata, and can be any string, such as org.linux-kvm.virtioport1. If specified, this will
 be exposed in the guest at /sys/class/virtio-ports/vport0p1/NAME--channel spicevmc,target_type=virtio[,name=NAME]
 Communication channel for QEMU spice agent, using virtio serial (requires 2.6.34 or later host and guest). NAME is optional
 metadata, and can be any string, such as the default com.redhat.spice.0 that specifies how the guest will see the channel.--console
 <br><br>Example:--console pty,target_type=virtio
 Connect a virtio console to the guest, redirected to a PTY on the host. For supported guests, this exposes /dev/hvc0 in the guest. See
 <a href=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/VirtioSerial>http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/VirtioSerial</a> for more info. virtio console requires libvirt 0.8.3 or later.--video=VIDEO
 <br><br>Mode is one of <b>host</b>, <b>host-certificates</b>, or <b>passthrough</b>. Additional options are:type
 Character device type to connect to on the host. This is only applicable for <b>passthrough</b> mode.An example invocation:
 --smartcard passthrough,type=spicevmc
 Use the smartcard channel of a SPICE graphics device to pass smartcard info to the guestSee http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsSmartcard<br><br><b>Miscellaneous Options</b>
 <br><br>If the guest has an install phase, you will need to use --print-step to specify exactly what XML output you want. This option implies
 --quiet.--print-step

 <br><br>semanage is used to configure certain elements of SELinux policy without requiring modification to or recompilation from policy sources. This includes the
 mapping from Linux usernames to SELinux user identities (which controls the initial security context assigned to Linux users when they login and bounds their
 authorized role set) as well as security context mappings for various kinds of objects, such as network ports, interfaces, and nodes (hosts) as well as the
 file context mapping. See the EXAMPLES section below for some examples of common usage. Note that the semanage login command deals with the mapping from Linux
 usernames (logins) to SELinux user identities, while the semanage user command deals with the mapping from SELinux user identities to authorized role sets. In
 most cases, only the former mapping needs to be adjusted by the administrator; the latter is principally defined by the base policy and usually does not
 require modification."},{"id": 18346,"commandid" : 2434,"title": "Options","page": "

 ebtables is an application program used to set up and maintain the tables of rules
 (inside the Linux kernel) that inspect Ethernet frames. It is analogous to the iptables application, but less complicated, due to the fact that the
 Ethernet protocol is much simpler than the IP protocol.
 ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE, RETURN, an extension (see below) or a jump to a user-defined chain.
 <br><br><b>ACCEPT</b> means to let the frame through. <b>DROP</b> means the frame has to be dropped. In the <b>BROUTING</b> chain however, the <b>ACCEPT</b> and
 <b>DROP</b> target have different meanings (see the info provided for the <b>-t</b> option). <b>CONTINUE</b> means the next rule has to be checked. This can be
 handy, f.e., to know how many frames pass a certain point in the chain, to log those frames or to apply multiple targets on a frame. <b>RETURN</b> means stop
 traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the previous (calling) chain. For the extension targets please refer to the <b>TARGET EXTENSIONS</b>
 section of this man page.Tablesfilter, nat and broute. Of these three tables, the filter table is the default table that the command operates on. If you are working with
 the filter table, then you can drop the -t filter argument to the -t, --table
 <br>
 <b>filter</b> is the default table and contains three built-in chains: <b>INPUT</b> (for frames destined for the bridge itself, on the level of the MAC
 destination address), <b>OUTPUT</b> (for locally-generated or (b)routed frames) and <b>FORWARD</b> (for frames being forwarded by the bridge).<p>
 <b>nat</b> is mostly used to change the mac addresses and contains three built-in chains: <b>PREROUTING</b> (for altering frames as soon as they come in),
 <b>OUTPUT</b> (for altering locally generated or (b)routed frames before they are bridged) and <b>POSTROUTING</b> (for altering frames as they are about to go
 out). A small note on the naming of chains PREROUTING and POSTROUTING: it would be more accurate to call them PREFORWARDING and POSTFORWARDING, but for all
 those who come from the iptables world to ebtables it is easier to have the same names. Note that you can change the name (<b>-E</b>) if you dont like the
 default.</p><p>
 <b>broute</b> is used to make a brouter, it has one built-in chain: <b>BROUTING</b>. The targets <b>DROP</b> and <b>ACCEPT</b> have a special meaning in the
 broute table (these names are used instead of more descriptive names to keep the implementation generic). <b>DROP</b> actually means the frame has to be
 routed, while <b>ACCEPT</b> means the frame has to be bridged. The <b>BROUTING</b> chain is traversed very early. However, it is only traversed by frames
 entering on a bridge port that is in forwarding state. Normally those frames would be bridged, but you can decide otherwise here. The <b>redirect</b> target is
 very handy here.</p>
 "},{"id": 18362,"commandid" : 2437,"title": "Ebtables Command Line Arguments","page": "
 After the initial -L and -Z are combined, the commands -N and -P are combined, or when --atomic-file is
 used.
 -A, --append
 Append a rule to the end of the selected chain.-D, --delete
 Delete the specified rule or rules from the selected chain. There are two ways to use this command. The first is by specifying an interval of rule numbers
 to delete (directly after <b>-D</b>). Syntax: start_nr[:end_nr] (use <b>-L --Ln</b> to list the rules with their rule number). When end_nr
 is omitted, all rules starting from start_nr are deleted. Using negative numbers is allowed, for more details about using negative numbers, see the
 <b>-I</b> command. The second usage is by specifying the complete rule as it would have been specified when it was added. Only the first encountered rule that
 is the same as this specified rule, in other words the matching rule with the lowest (positive) rule number, is deleted.-C, --change-counters
 Change the counters of the specified rule or rules from the selected chain. There are two ways to use this command. The first is by specifying an interval
 of rule numbers to do the changes on (directly after <b>-C</b>). Syntax: start_nr[:end_nr] (use <b>-L --Ln</b> to list the rules with their rule
 number). The details are the same as for the <b>-D</b> command. The second usage is by specifying the complete rule as it would have been specified when it was
 added. Only the counters of the first encountered rule that is the same as this specified rule, in other words the matching rule with the lowest (positive)
 rule number, are changed. In the first usage, the counters are specified directly after the interval specification, in the second usage directly after
 <b>-C</b>. First the packet counter is specified, then the byte counter. If the specified counters start with a +, the counter values are added to the
 respective current counter values. If the specified counters start with a -, the counter values are decreased from the respective current counter values. No
 bounds checking is done. If the counters dont start with + or -, the current counters are changed to the specified counters.-I, --insert
 Insert the specified rule into the selected chain at the specified rule number. If the rule number is not specified, the rule is added at the head of the
 chain. If the current number of rules equals N, then the specified number can be between -N and N+1. For a positive number i, it
 holds that i and i-N-1 specify the same place in the chain where the rule should be inserted. The rule number 0 specifies the place past the last
 rule in the chain and using this number is therefore equivalent to using the <b>-A</b> command. Rule numbers structly smaller than 0 can be useful when more
 than one rule needs to be inserted in a chain.-P, --policy
 Set the policy for the chain to the given target. The policy can be <b>ACCEPT</b>, <b>DROP</b> or <b>RETURN</b>.-F, --flush
 Flush the selected chain. If no chain is selected, then every chain will be flushed. Flushing a chain does not change the policy of the chain, however.-Z, --zero
 Set the counters of the selected chain to zero. If no chain is selected, all the counters are set to zero. The <b>-Z</b> command can be used in conjunction
 with the <b>-L</b> command. When both the <b>-Z</b> and <b>-L</b> commands are used together in this way, the rule counters are printed on the screen before
 they are set to zero.-L, --list
 List all rules in the selected chain. If no chain is selected, all chains are listed.<br>
 The following options change the output of the <b>-L</b> command.<br>
 <b>--Ln</b><br>
 Places the rule number in front of every rule. This option is incompatible with the <b>--Lx</b> option.<br>
 <b>--Lc</b><br>
 Shows the counters at the end of each rule displayed by the <b>-L</b> command. Both a frame counter (pcnt) and a byte counter (bcnt) are displayed. The frame
 counter shows how many frames have matched the specific rule, the byte counter shows the sum of the frame sizes of these matching frames. Using this option in
 combination with the <b>--Lx</b> option causes the counters to be written out in the <b>-c</b> &lt;pcnt&gt; &lt;bcnt&gt; option format.<br>
 <b>--Lx</b><br>
 Changes the output so that it produces a set of ebtables commands that construct the contents of the chain, when specified. If no chain is specified, ebtables
 commands to construct the contents of the table are given, including commands for creating the user-defined chains (if any). You can use this set of commands
 in an ebtables boot or reload script. For example the output could be used at system startup. The <b>--Lx</b> option is incompatible with the <b>--Ln</b>
 listing option. Using the <b>--Lx</b> option together with the <b>--Lc</b> option will cause the counters to be written out in the <b>-c</b> &lt;pcnt&gt;
 &lt;bcnt&gt; option format.<br>
 <b>--Lmac2</b><br>
 Shows all MAC addresses with the same length, adding leading zeroes if necessary. The default representation omits leading zeroes in the addresses.-N, --new-chain
 Create a new user-defined chain with the given name. The number of user-defined chains is limited only by the number of possible chain names. A
 user-defined chain name has a maximum length of 31 characters. The standard policy of the user-defined chain is ACCEPT. The policy of the new chain can be
 initialized to a different standard target by using the <b>-P</b> command together with the <b>-N</b> command. In this case, the chain name does not have to be
 specified for the <b>-P</b> command.-X, --delete-chain
 Delete the specified user-defined chain. There must be no remaining references (jumps) to the specified chain, otherwise ebtables will refuse to delete it.
 If no chain is specified, all user-defined chains that arent referenced will be removed.-E, --rename-chain
 Rename the specified chain to a new name. Besides renaming a user-defined chain, you can rename a standard chain to a name that suits your taste. For
 example, if you like PREFORWARDING more than PREROUTING, then you can use the -E command to rename the PREROUTING chain. If you do rename one of the standard
 ebtables chain names, please be sure to mention this fact should you post a question on the ebtables mailing lists. It would be wise to use the standard name
 in your post. Renaming a standard ebtables chain in this fashion has no effect on the structure or functioning of the ebtables kernel table.--init-table
 Replace the current table data by the initial table data.--atomic-init
 Copy the kernels initial data of the table to the specified file. This can be used as the first action, after which rules are added to the file. The file
 can be specified using the <b>--atomic-file</b> command or through the EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE environment variable.--atomic-save
 Copy the kernels current data of the table to the specified file. This can be used as the first action, after which rules are added to the file. The file
 can be specified using the <b>--atomic-file</b> command or through the EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE environment variable.--atomic-commit
 Replace the kernel table data with the data contained in the specified file. This is a useful command that allows you to load all your rules of a certain
 table into the kernel at once, saving the kernel a lot of precious time and allowing atomic updates of the tables. The file which contains the table data is
 constructed by using either the <b>--atomic-init</b> or the <b>--atomic-save</b> command to generate a starting file. After that, using the
 <b>--atomic-file</b> command when constructing rules or setting the EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE environment variable allows you to extend the file and build
 the complete table before committing it to the kernel. This command can be very useful in boot scripts to populate the ebtables tables in a fast way.
 -V, --version
 Show the version of the ebtables userspace program.-h, --help [Give a brief description of the command syntax. Here you can also specify names of extensions and ebtables will try to write help about those extensions.
 E.g. ebtables -h snat log ip arp. Specify list_extensions to list all extensions supported by the userspace utility.-j, --jump The target of the rule. This is one of the following values: <b>ACCEPT</b>, <b>DROP</b>, <b>CONTINUE</b>, <b>RETURN</b>, a target extension (see <b>TARGET
 EXTENSIONS</b>) or a user-defined chain name.--atomic-file file
 Let the command operate on the specified file. The data of the table to operate on will be extracted from the file and the result of the operation
 will be saved back into the file. If specified, this option should come before the command specification. An alternative that should be preferred, is setting
 the EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE environment variable.-M, --modprobe program
 When talking to the kernel, use this program to try to automatically load missing kernel modules.
 <p>RULE SPECIFICATIONS The following command line arguments make up a rule specification (as used in the add and delete commands). A ! option before the
 specification inverts the test for that specification. Apart from these standard rule specifications there are some other command line arguments of interest.
 See both the <b>MATCH EXTENSIONS</b> and the <b>WATCHER EXTENSIONS</b> below.
 </p>-p, --protocol [!] The protocol that was responsible for creating the frame. This can be a hexadecimal number, above 0x0600, a name (e.g. ARP ) or
 <b>LENGTH</b>. The protocol field of the Ethernet frame can be used to denote the length of the header (802.2/802.3 networks). When the value of that field is
 below or equals 0x0600, the value equals the size of the header and shouldnt be used as a protocol number. Instead, all frames where the protocol field
 is used as the length field are assumed to be of the same protocol. The protocol name used in ebtables for these frames is <b>LENGTH</b>.<br>
 The file <b>/etc/ethertypes</b> can be used to show readable characters instead of hexadecimal numbers for the protocols. For example, 0x0800 will be
 represented by IPV4. The use of this file is not case sensitive. See that file for more information. The flag <b>--proto</b> is an alias for this
 option.-i, --in-interface [!] The interface (bridge port) via which a frame is received (this option is useful in the <b>INPUT</b>, <b>FORWARD</b>, <b>PREROUTING</b> and <b>BROUTING</b>
 chains). If the interface name ends with +, then any interface name that begins with this name (disregarding +) will match. The flag <b>--in-if</b> is an
 alias for this option.--logical-in [!] The (logical) bridge interface via which a frame is received (this option is useful in the <b>INPUT</b>, <b>FORWARD</b>, <b>PREROUTING</b> and
 <b>BROUTING</b> chains). If the interface name ends with +, then any interface name that begins with this name (disregarding +) will match.-o, --out-interface [!] The interface (bridge port) via which a frame is going to be sent (this option is useful in the <b>OUTPUT</b>, <b>FORWARD</b> and <b>POSTROUTING</b>
 chains). If the interface name ends with +, then any interface name that begins with this name (disregarding +) will match. The flag <b>--out-if</b> is an
 alias for this option.--logical-out [!] The (logical) bridge interface via which a frame is going to be sent (this option is useful in the <b>OUTPUT</b>, <b>FORWARD</b> and <b>POSTROUTING</b>
 chains). If the interface name ends with +, then any interface name that begins with this name (disregarding +) will match.-s, --source [!] The source MAC address. Both mask and address are written as 6 hexadecimal numbers separated by colons. Alternatively one can specify Unicast, Multicast,
 Broadcast or BGA (Bridge Group Address):<br>
 Unicast=00:00:00:00:00:00/01:00:00:00:00:00, Multicast=01:00:00:00:00:00/01:00:00:00:00:00, Broadcast=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff/ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
 or BGA=01:80:c2:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Note that a broadcast address will also match the multicast specification. The flag <b>--src</b> is an alias
 for this option.-d, --destination [!] The destination MAC address. See <b>-s</b> (above) for more details on MAC addresses. The flag <b>--dst</b> is an alias for this option.-c, --set-counter If used with <b>-A</b> or <b>-I</b>, then the packet and byte counters of the new rule will be set to pcnt, resp. bcnt. If used with the
 <b>-C</b> or <b>-D</b> commands, only rules with a packet and byte count equal to pcnt, resp. bcnt will match.
 --802_3-sap [!] DSAP and SSAP are two one byte 802.3 fields. The bytes are always equal, so only one byte (hexadecimal) is needed as an argument.--802_3-type [!] If the 802.3 DSAP and SSAP values are 0xaa then the SNAP type field must be consulted to determine the payload protocol. This is a two byte (hexadecimal)
 argument. Only 802.3 frames with DSAP/SSAP 0xaa are checked for type.
 --among-dst [!] Compare the MAC destination to the given list. If the Ethernet frame has type IPv4 or ARP, then comparison with MAC/IP destination address
 pairs from the list is possible.--among-src [!] Compare the MAC source to the given list. If the Ethernet frame has type IPv4 or ARP, then comparison with MAC/IP source address pairs from
 the list is possible.--among-dst-file [!] Same as <b>--among-dst</b> but the list is read in from the specified file.--among-src-file [!] Same as <b>--among-src</b> but the list is read in from the specified file.
 --arp-opcode [!] The (R)ARP opcode (decimal or a string, for more details see <b>ebtables -h arp</b>).--arp-htype [!] The hardware type, this can be a decimal or the string Ethernet (which sets type to 1). Most (R)ARP packets have Eternet as hardware type.--arp-ptype [!] The protocol type for which the (r)arp is used (hexadecimal or the string IPv4, denoting 0x0800). Most (R)ARP packets have protocol type IPv4.--arp-ip-src [!] The (R)ARP IP source address specification.--arp-ip-dst [!] The (R)ARP IP destination address specification.--arp-mac-src [!] The (R)ARP MAC source address specification.--arp-mac-dst [!] The (R)ARP MAC destination address specification.[!] --arp-gratuitous
 Checks for ARP gratuitous packets: checks equality of IPv4 source address and IPv4 destination address inside the ARP header.
 --ip-source [!] The source IP address. The flag <b>--ip-src</b> is an alias for this option.--ip-destination [!] The destination IP address. The flag <b>--ip-dst</b> is an alias for this option.--ip-tos [!] The IP type of service, in hexadecimal numbers. <b>IPv4</b>.--ip-protocol [!] The IP protocol. The flag <b>--ip-proto</b> is an alias for this option.--ip-source-port [!] The source port or port range for the IP protocols 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 33 (DCCP) or 132 (SCTP). The <b>--ip-protocol</b> option must be specified as
 TCP, UDP, DCCP or SCTP. If port1 is omitted, 0:port2 is used; if port2 is omitted but a colon is specified,
 port1:65535 is used. The flag <b>--ip-sport</b> is an alias for this option.--ip-destination-port [!] The destination port or port range for ip protocols 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 33 (DCCP) or 132 (SCTP). The <b>--ip-protocol</b> option must be specified as
 TCP, UDP, DCCP or SCTP. If port1 is omitted, 0:port2 is used; if port2 is omitted but a colon is specified,
 port1:65535 is used. The flag <b>--ip-dport</b> is an alias for this option.
 --ip6-source [!] The source IPv6 address. The flag <b>--ip6-src</b> is an alias for this option.--ip6-destination [!] The destination IPv6 address. The flag <b>--ip6-dst</b> is an alias for this option.--ip6-tclass [!] The IPv6 traffic class, in hexadecimal numbers.--ip6-protocol [!] The IP protocol. The flag <b>--ip6-proto</b> is an alias for this option.--ip6-source-port [!] The source port or port range for the IPv6 protocols 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 33 (DCCP) or 132 (SCTP). The <b>--ip6-protocol</b> option must be specified as
 TCP, UDP, DCCP or SCTP. If port1 is omitted, 0:port2 is used; if port2 is omitted but a colon is specified,
 port1:65535 is used. The flag <b>--ip6-sport</b> is an alias for this option.--ip6-destination-port [!] The destination port or port range for IPv6 protocols 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 33 (DCCP) or 132 (SCTP). The <b>--ip6-protocol</b> option must be specified as
 TCP, UDP, DCCP or SCTP. If port1 is omitted, 0:port2 is used; if port2 is omitted but a colon is specified,
 port1:65535 is used. The flag <b>--ip6-dport</b> is an alias for this option.
 --log watcher to give limited logging, for example. Its use is the same as the limit
 match of iptables.
 --limit [Maximum average matching rate: specified as a number, with an optional /second, /minute, /hour, or /day suffix; the default is
 3/hour.--limit-burst [Maximum initial number of packets to match: this number gets recharged by one every time the limit specified above is not reached, up to this number; the
 default is 5.
 --mark [!] [Matches frames with the given unsigned mark value. If a value and mask are specified, the logical AND of the mark value of the frame and the
 user-specified mask is taken before comparing it with the user-specified mark value. When only a mark value is specified, the packet only
 matches when the mark value of the frame equals the user-specified mark value. If only a mask is specified, the logical AND of the mark value of
 the frame and the user-specified mask is taken and the frame matches when the result of this logical AND is non-zero. Only specifying a mask is
 useful to match multiple mark values.
 --pkttype-type [!] Matches on the Ethernet class of the frame, which is determined by the generic networking code. Possible values: broadcast (MAC destination is the
 broadcast address), multicast (MAC destination is a multicast address), host (MAC destination is the receiving network device), or
 otherhost (none of the above).
 -d) must be
 specified as the bridge group address (--stp-type [!] The BPDU type (0-255), recognized non-numerical types are config, denoting a configuration BPDU (=0), and tcn, denothing a topology change
 notification BPDU (=128).--stp-flags [!] The BPDU flag (0-255), recognized non-numerical flags are topology-change, denoting the topology change flag (=1), and topology-change-ack,
 denoting the topology change acknowledgement flag (=128).--stp-root-prio [!] [The root priority (0-65535) range.--stp-root-addr [!] [The root mac address, see the option <b>-s</b> for more details.--stp-root-cost [!] [The root path cost (0-4294967295) range.--stp-sender-prio [!] [The BPDUs sender priority (0-65535) range.--stp-sender-addr [!] [The BPDUs sender mac address, see the option <b>-s</b> for more details.--stp-port [!] [The port identifier (0-65535) range.--stp-msg-age [!] [The message age timer (0-65535) range.--stp-max-age [!] [The max age timer (0-65535) range.--stp-hello-time [!] [The hello time timer (0-65535) range.--stp-forward-delay [!] [The forward delay timer (0-65535) range.
 --vlan-id [!] The VLAN identifier field (VID). Decimal number from 0 to 4095.--vlan-prio [!] The user priority field, a decimal number from 0 to 7. The VID should be set to 0 (null VID) or unspecified (in the latter case the VID is deliberately
 set to 0).--vlan-encap [!] The encapsulated Ethernet frame type/length. Specified as a hexadecimal number from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF or as a symbolic name from
 <b>/etc/ethertypes</b>.
 --log
 <br>
 Log with the default loggin options: log-level= info, log-prefix=, no ip logging, no arp logging.--log-level level
 <br>
 Defines the logging level. For the possible values, see <b>ebtables -h log</b>. The default level is info.--log-prefix <br>
 Defines the prefix text to be printed at the beginning of the line with the logging information.--log-ip
 <br>
 Will log the ip information when a frame made by the ip protocol matches the rule. The default is no ip information logging.--log-ip6
 <br>
 Will log the ipv6 information when a frame made by the ipv6 protocol matches the rule. The default is no ipv6 information logging.--log-arp
 <br>
 Will log the (r)arp information when a frame made by the (r)arp protocols matches the rule. The default is no (r)arp information logging.
 --nflog
 <br>
 Log with the default logging options--nflog-group nlgroup
 <br>
 The netlink group (1 - 2^32-1) to which packets are (only applicable for nfnetlink_log). The default value is 1.--nflog-prefix prefix
 <br>
 A prefix string to include in the log message, up to 30 characters long, useful for distinguishing messages in the logs.--nflog-range size
 <br>
 The number of bytes to be copied to userspace (only applicable for nfnetlink_log). nfnetlink_log instances may specify their own range, this option overrides
 it.--nflog-threshold size
 <br>
 Number of packets to queue inside the kernel before sending them to userspace (only applicable for nfnetlink_log). Higher values result in less overhead per
 packet, but increase delay until the packets reach userspace. The default value is 1.
 nlbufsiz specifies how
 big the buffer for each netlink multicast group is. If you say flushtimeout specifies after how many hundredths of a
 second the queue should be flushed, even if it is not full yet. The default is 10 (one tenth of a second).
 --ulog
 <br>
 Use the default settings: ulog-prefix=, ulog-nlgroup=1, ulog-cprange=4096, ulog-qthreshold=1.--ulog-prefix text
 <br>
 Defines the prefix included with the packets sent to userspace.--ulog-nlgroup <br>
 Defines which netlink group number to use (a number from 1 to 32). Make sure the netlink group numbers used for the iptables ULOG target differ from those used
 for the ebtables ulog watcher. The default group number is 1.--ulog-cprange <br>
 Defines the maximum copy range to userspace, for packets matching the rule. The default range is 0, which means the maximum copy range is given by
 <b>nlbufsiz</b>. A maximum copy range larger than 128*1024 is meaningless as the packets sent to userspace have an upper size limit of 128*1024.--ulog-qthreshold <br>
 Queue at most threshold number of packets before sending them to userspace with a netlink socket. Note that packets can be sent to userspace before the
 queue is full, this happens when the ulog kernel timer goes off (the frequency of this timer depends on <b>flushtimeout</b>).
 arpreply target can be used in the PREROUTING chain of the nat table.
 If this target sees an ARP request it will automatically reply with an ARP reply. The used MAC address for the reply can be specified. The protocol must be
 specified as CONTINUE). When the ARP request is malformed, it is dropped (DROP).
 --arpreply-mac Specifies the MAC address to reply with: the Ethernet source MAC and the ARP payload source MAC will be filled in with this address.--arpreply-target Specifies the standard target. After sending the ARP reply, the rule still has to give a standard target so ebtables knows what to do with the ARP request.
 The default target is <b>DROP</b>.
 dnat target can only be used in the BROUTING chain of the broute table and
 the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains of the nat table. It specifies that the destination MAC address has to be changed.
 --to-destination <br>
 Change the destination MAC address to the specified address. The flag <b>--to-dst</b> is an alias for this option.--dnat-target <br>
 Specifies the standard target. After doing the dnat, the rule still has to give a standard target so ebtables knows what to do with the dnated frame. The
 default target is <b>ACCEPT</b>. Making it <b>CONTINUE</b> could let you use multiple target extensions on the same frame. Making it <b>DROP</b> only makes
 sense in the <b>BROUTING</b> chain but using the <b>redirect</b> target is more logical there. <b>RETURN</b> is also allowed. Note that using <b>RETURN</b> in
 a base chain is not allowed (for obvious reasons).
 mark target can be used in every chain of every table. It is possible to use the marking
 of a frame/packet in both --mark-set <br>
 Mark the frame with the specified non-negative value.--mark-or <br>
 Or the frame with the specified non-negative value.--mark-and <br>
 And the frame with the specified non-negative value.--mark-xor <br>
 Xor the frame with the specified non-negative value.--mark-target <br>
 Specifies the standard target. After marking the frame, the rule still has to give a standard target so ebtables knows what to do. The default target is
 <b>ACCEPT</b>. Making it <b>CONTINUE</b> can let you do other things with the frame in subsequent rules of the chain.
 redirect target will change the MAC target address to that of the bridge device the
 frame arrived on. This target can only be used in the BROUTING chain of the broute table and the PREROUTING chain of the nat table.
 In the BROUTING chain, the MAC address of the bridge port is used as destination address, in the PREROUTING chain, the MAC address of the bridge
 is used.
 --redirect-target <br>
 Specifies the standard target. After doing the MAC redirect, the rule still has to give a standard target so ebtables knows what to do. The default target is
 <b>ACCEPT</b>. Making it <b>CONTINUE</b> could let you use multiple target extensions on the same frame. Making it <b>DROP</b> in the <b>BROUTING</b> chain
 will let the frames be routed. <b>RETURN</b> is also allowed. Note that using <b>RETURN</b> in a base chain is not allowed.
 snat target can only be used in the POSTROUTING chain of the nat table. It
 specifies that the source MAC address has to be changed.
 --to-source <br>
 Changes the source MAC address to the specified address. The flag <b>--to-src</b> is an alias for this option.--snat-target <br>
 Specifies the standard target. After doing the snat, the rule still has to give a standard target so ebtables knows what to do. The default target is
 <b>ACCEPT</b>. Making it <b>CONTINUE</b> could let you use multiple target extensions on the same frame. Making it <b>DROP</b> doesnt make sense, but you
 could do that too. <b>RETURN</b> is also allowed. Note that using <b>RETURN</b> in a base chain is not allowed.<br>--snat-arp
 <br>
 Also change the hardware source address inside the arp header if the packet is an arp message and the hardware address length in the arp header is 6
 bytes.<br>

 <br><br><b>tmux</b> is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. <b>tmux</b> may be
 detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.<br><br>When <b>tmux</b> is started it creates a new session with a single window and displays it on screen. A status line at the bottom of the screen
 shows information on the current session and is used to enter interactive commands.<br><br>A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management of <b>tmux</b>. Each session has one or more windows linked to it. A window
 occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the <b>pty</b>(4) manual page documents the technical
 details of pseudo terminals). Any number of <b>tmux</b> instances may connect to the same session, and any number of windows may be present in the same
 session. Once all sessions are killed, <b>tmux</b> exits.<br><br>Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as <b><a href=ssh>ssh</a></b>(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the C-b d key
 strokes). <b>tmux</b> may be reattached using:
 <br><br>In <b>tmux</b>, a session is displayed on screen by a client and all sessions are managed by a single server. The server and each client are
 separate processes which communicate through a socket in /tmp.<br><br>The options are as follows:-2              Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.<b>-8</b> Like <b>-2</b>, but indicates that the terminal supports 88 colours.
 <p><b>-c</b> shell-command<br>
 Execute shell-command using the default shell. If necessary, the <b>tmux</b> server will be started to retrieve the <b>default-shell</b> option. This
 option is for compatibility with <b><a href=sh>sh</a></b>(1) when <b>tmux</b> is used as a login shell.
 </p><p><b>-f</b> file Specify an alternative configuration file. By default, <b>tmux</b> loads the system configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if
 present, then looks for a user configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf. The configuration file is a set of <b>tmux</b> commands which are executed in
 sequence when the server is first started.
 </p><p>If a command in the configuration file fails, <b>tmux</b> will report an error and exit without executing further commands.
 </p><p><b>-L</b> socket-name<b><br>
 tmux</b> stores the server socket in a directory under /tmp (or TMPDIR if set); the default socket is named default. This option allows a
 different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent <b>tmux</b> servers to be run. Unlike <b>-S</b> a full path is not necessary: the sockets
 are all created in the same directory.
 </p><p>If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the <b>tmux</b> server process to recreate it.
 </p><p><b>-l</b> Behave as a login shell. This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

 </p><p><b>-q</b> Set the <b>quiet</b> server option to prevent the server sending various informational messages.
 </p><p><b>-S</b> socket-path<br>
 Specify a full alternative path to the server socket. If <b>-S</b> is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any <b>-L</b> flag is ignored.

 </p><p><b>-u</b> <b>tmux</b> attempts to guess if the terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the first of the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment
 variables to be set for the string UTF-8. This is not always correct: the <b>-u</b> flag explicitly informs <b>tmux</b> that UTF-8 is supported.

 </p><p>If the server is started from a client passed <b>-u</b> or where UTF-8 is detected, the <b>utf8</b> and <b>status-utf8</b> options are enabled in the global
 window and session options respectively.
 </p><p><b>-v</b> Request verbose logging. This option may be specified multiple times for increasing verbosity. Log messages will be saved into
 tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory, where PID is the PID of the server or client process.

 </p><p><b>-V</b> Report the <b>tmux</b> version.
 </p><p>command [flags]<br>

 </p><h2>Commands</h2>

 <br><br>This section contains a list of the commands supported by <b>tmux</b>. Most commands accept the optional <b>-t</b> argument with one of
 target-client, target-session target-window, or target-pane. These specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should
 affect. target-client is the name of the <b>pty</b>(4) file to which the client is connected, for example either of /dev/ttyp1 or ttyp1 for the
 client attached to /dev/ttyp1. If no client is specified, the current client is chosen, if possible, or an error is reported. Clients may be listed with
 the <b>list-clients</b> command.<br><br>target-session is either the name of a session (as listed by the <b>list-sessions</b> command) or the name of a client with the same syntax as
 target-client, in which case the session attached to the client is used. When looking for the session name, <b>tmux</b> initially searches for an exact
 match; if none is found, the session names are checked for any for which target-session is a prefix or for which it matches as an <b><a href=/man/3/fnmatch>fnmatch</a></b>(3) pattern. If
 a single match is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches produce an error. If a session is omitted, the current session is used if
 available; if no current session is available, the most recently used is chosen.<br><br>target-window specifies a window in the form session:window. session follows the same rules as for target-session, and
 window is looked for in order: as a window index, for example mysession:1; as an exact window name, such as mysession:mywindow; then as an <b><a href=/man/3/fnmatch rel=nofollow>fnmatch</a></b>(3)
 pattern or the start of a window name, such as mysession:mywin* or mysession:mywin. An empty window name specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for
 example the <b>new-window</b> and <b>link-window</b> commands) otherwise the current window in session is chosen. The special character ! uses the
 last (previously current) window, or + and - are the next window or the previous window by number. When the argument does not contain a colon, <b>tmux</b>
 first attempts to parse it as window; if that fails, an attempt is made to match a session.<br><br>target-pane takes a similar form to target-window but with the optional addition of a period followed by a pane index, for example:
 mysession:mywindow.1. If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified window is used. If neither a colon nor period appears,
 <b>tmux</b> first attempts to use the argument as a pane index; if that fails, it is looked up as for target-window. A + or - indicate the next or
 previous pane index, respectively. One of the strings top, bottom, left, right, top-left, top-right,
 bottom-left or bottom-right may be used instead of a pane index.<br><br>The special characters + and - may be followed by an offset, for example:select-window -t:+2<br><br><b>tmux</b> also gives each pane created in a server an identifier consisting of a % and a number, starting from zero. A panes identifier is unique for
 the life of the <b>tmux</b> server and is passed to the child process of the pane in the TMUX_PANE environment variable. It may be used alone to target a pane
 or the window containing it.<br><br>shell-command arguments are <b><a href=sh rel=nofollow>sh</a></b>(1) commands. These must be passed as a single item, which typically means quoting them, for example:new-window vi /etc/passwdtmux command, passed with the command and arguments separately, for example:
 <a href=sh rel=nofollow>sh</a>(1):
 bind-key).
 <br><br>Example <b>tmux</b> commands include: refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

 rename-session -tfirst newname

 set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

 new-window ; split-window -d<a href=sh rel=nofollow>sh</a>(1):

 <br><br>The <b>tmux</b> server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes. Clients are attached to sessions to interact with them, either when they are created
 with the <b>new-session</b> command, or later with the <b>attach-session</b> command. Each session has one or more windows linked into it. Windows may
 be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal. Commands for creating, linking and otherwise
 manipulating windows are covered in the WINDOWS AND PANES section.<br><br>The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:attach-session [-dr] [-t (alias: <b>attach</b>) If run from outside <b>tmux</b>, create a new client in the current terminal and attach it to target-session. If used from
 inside, switch the current client. If <b>-d</b> is specified, any other clients attached to the session are detached. <b>-r</b> signifies the client is
 read-only (only keys bound to the <b>detach-client</b> command have any effect)
 <p>If no server is started, <b>attach-session</b> will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions are created in the configuration file.

 </p><p>The target-session rules for <b>attach-session</b> are slightly adjusted: if <b>tmux</b> needs to select the most recently used session, it will
 prefer the most recently used unattached session.
 </p><p><b>detach-client</b> [<b>-P</b>] [<b>-s</b> target-session] [<b>-t</b> target-client]<br>
 (alias: <b>detach</b>) Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with <b>-t</b>, or all clients currently attached to to the session
 specified by <b>-s</b>. If <b>-P</b> is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client, typically causing it to exit.
 </p><p><b>has-session</b> [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 (alias: <b>has</b>) Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist. If it does exist, exit with 0.
 </p><p><b>kill-server</b><br>
 Kill the <b>tmux</b> server and clients and destroy all sessions.
 </p><p><b>kill-session</b> [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.
 </p><p><b>list-clients</b> [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 (alias: <b>lsc</b>) List all clients attached to the server. If target-session is specified, list only clients connected to that session.

 </p><p><b>list-commands</b><br>
 (alias: <b>lscm</b>) List the syntax of all commands supported by <b>tmux</b>.
 </p><p><b>list-sessions</b><br>
 (alias: <b>ls</b>) List all sessions managed by the server.
 </p><p><b>lock-client</b> [<b>-t</b> target-client]<br>
 (alias: <b>lockc</b>) Lock target-client, see the <b>lock-server</b> command.
 </p><p><b>lock-session</b> [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 (alias: <b>locks</b>) Lock all clients attached to target-session.
 </p><p><b>new-session</b> [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-n</b> window-name] [<b>-s</b> session-name] [<b>-t</b> target-session] [<b>-x</b> width]
 [<b>-y</b> height] [shell-command]<br>
 (alias: <b>new</b>) Create a new session with name session-name.
 </p><p>The new session is attached to the current terminal unless <b>-d</b> is given. window-name and shell-command are the name of and shell command
 to execute in the initial window. If <b>-d</b> is used, <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> specify the size of the initial window (80 by 24 if not given).

 </p><p>If run from a terminal, any <b>termios</b>(4) special characters are saved and used for new windows in the new session.
 </p><p>If <b>-t</b> is given, the new session is grouped with target-session. This means they share the same set of windows - all windows from
 target-session are linked to the new session and any subsequent new windows or windows being closed are applied to both sessions. The current and
 previous window and any session options remain independent and either session may be killed without affecting the other. Giving <b>-n</b> or
 shell-command are invalid if <b>-t</b> is used.
 </p><p><b>refresh-client</b> [<b>-t</b> target-client]<br>
 (alias: <b>refresh</b>) Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given with <b>-t</b>.
 </p><p><b>rename-session</b> [<b>-t</b> target-session] new-name<br>
 (alias: <b>rename</b>) Rename the session to new-name.
 </p><p><b>show-messages</b> [<b>-t</b> target-client]<br>
 (alias: <b>showmsgs</b>) Any messages displayed on the status line are saved in a per-client message log, up to a maximum of the limit set by the
 message-limit session option for the session attached to that client. This command displays the log for target-client.
 </p><p><b>source-file</b> path<br>
 (alias: <b>source</b>) Execute commands from path.
 </p><p><b>start-server</b><br>
 (alias: <b>start</b>) Start the <b>tmux</b> server, if not already running, without creating any sessions.
 </p><p><b>suspend-client</b> [<b>-t</b> target-client]<br>
 (alias: <b>suspendc</b>) Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).
 </p><p><b>switch-client</b> [<b>-lnp</b>] [<b>-c</b> target-client] [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 (alias: <b>switchc</b>) Switch the current session for client target-client to target-session. If <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b> is used, the
 client is moved to the last, next or previous session respectively.
 </p><h2>Windows And Panes</h2>

 <br><br>A <b>tmux</b> window may be in one of several modes. The default permits direct access to the terminal attached to the window. The other is copy mode, which
 permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to a paste buffer for later insertion into another window. This mode is entered with the
 <b>copy-mode</b> command, bound to [ by default. It is also entered when a command that produces output, such as <b>list-keys</b>, is executed from a key
 binding.<br><br>The keys available depend on whether emacs or vi mode is selected (see the <b>mode-keys</b> option). The following keys are supported as appropriate for the
 mode:
 Function vi emacs

 Start of line 0 C-a
 Start selection Space C-Space
 Top of history g M->
 Transpose chars C-t
 <br><br>The next and previous word keys use space and the -, _ and @ characters as word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by setting the
 word-separators window option. Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and previous word to the start
 of the previous word. The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word separator.<br><br>The jump commands enable quick movement within a line. For instance, typing f followed by / will move the cursor to the next / character on the
 current line. A ; will then jump to the next occurrence.<br><br>Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count. With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt
 (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry. For example, to move the cursor forward by ten words, use M-1 0 M-f in emacs mode, and 10w in vi.<br><br>Mode key bindings are defined in a set of named tables: vi-edit and emacs-edit for keys used when line editing at the command prompt;
 vi-choice and emacs-choice for keys used when choosing from lists (such as produced by the <b>choose-window</b> command); and vi-copy and
 emacs-copy used in copy mode. The tables may be viewed with the <b>list-keys</b> command and keys modified or removed with <b>bind-key</b> and
 <b>unbind-key</b>.<br><br>The paste buffer key pastes the first line from the top paste buffer on the stack.<br><br>The synopsis for the <b>copy-mode</b> command is:
 copy-mode [-u] [-t Enter copy mode. The <b>-u</b> option scrolls one page up.
 <p>Each window displayed by <b>tmux</b> may be split into one or more panes; each pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate
 terminal. A window may be split into panes using the <b>split-window</b> command. Windows may be split horizontally (with the <b>-h</b> flag) or vertically.
 Panes may be resized with the <b>resize-pane</b> command (bound to C-up, C-down C-left and C-right by default), the current pane may be changed with
 the <b>select-pane</b> command and the <b>rotate-window</b> and <b>swap-pane</b> commands may be used to swap panes without changing their position. Panes are
 numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.
 </p><p>A number of preset layouts are available. These may be selected with the <b>select-layout</b> command or cycled with <b>next-layout</b> (bound to
 Space by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.
 </p><p>The following layouts are supported:
 </p><p><b>even-horizontal</b><br>
 Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.
 </p><p><b>even-vertical</b><br>
 Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.
 </p><p><b>main-horizontal</b><br>
 A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom. Use the
 main-pane-height window option to specify the height of the top pane.
 </p><p><b>main-vertical</b><br>
 Similar to <b>main-horizontal</b> but the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right. See the
 main-pane-width window option.
 </p><p><b>tiled</b><br>
 Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.
 </p><p>In addition, <b>select-layout</b> may be used to apply a previously used layout - the <b>list-windows</b> command displays the layout of each window in a
 form suitable for use with <b>select-layout</b>. For example:
 </p><p>$ tmux list-windows<br>
 0: ksh [159x48]<br>
 layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}<br>
 $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
 </p><p><b>tmux</b> automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size. Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than
 that from which the layout was originally defined.
 </p><p>Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:
 </p>
 break-pane [-d] [-t (alias: <b>breakp</b>) Break target-pane off from its containing window to make it the only pane in a new window. If <b>-d</b> is given, the new
 window does not become the current window.
 <p><b>capture-pane</b> [<b>-b</b> buffer-index] [<b>-E</b> end-line] [<b>-S</b> start-line] [<b>-t</b> target-pane]<br>
 (alias: <b>capturep</b>) Capture the contents of a pane to the specified buffer, or a new buffer if none is specified.
 </p><p><b>-S</b> and <b>-E</b> specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the
 history. The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.
 </p><p><b>choose-client</b> [<b>-t</b> target-window] [template]<br>
 Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list. After a client is chosen, %% is replaced by the client
 <b>pty</b>(4) path in template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, detach-client -t %% is used. This command works only
 from inside <b>tmux</b>.
 </p><p><b>choose-session</b> [<b>-t</b> target-window] [template]<br>
 Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may be selected interactively from a list. When one is chosen, %% is replaced by the session name in
 template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, switch-client -t %% is used. This command works only from inside
 <b>tmux</b>.
 </p><p><b>choose-window</b> [<b>-t</b> target-window] [template]<br>
 Put a window into window choice mode, where a window may be chosen interactively from a list. After a window is selected, %% is replaced by the session name
 and window index in template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, select-window -t %% is used. This command works
 only from inside <b>tmux</b>.
 </p><p><b>display-panes</b> [<b>-t</b> target-client]<br>
 (alias: <b>displayp)</b> Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by target-client. See the <b>display-panes-time</b>,
 <b>display-panes-colour</b>, and <b>display-panes-active-colour</b> session options. While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be selected with the 0 to
 9 keys.
 </p><p><b>find-window</b> [<b>-t</b> target-window] match-string<br>
 (alias: <b>findw</b>) Search for the <b><a href=/man/3/fnmatch rel=nofollow>fnmatch</a></b>(3) pattern match-string in window names, titles, and visible content (but not history). If only one window
 is matched, itll be automatically selected, otherwise a choice list is shown. This command only works from inside <b>tmux</b>.
 </p><p><b>join-pane</b> [<b>-dhv</b>] [<b><br>
 -l</b> size | <b>-p</b> percentage] [<b>-s</b> src-pane] [<b>-t</b> dst-pane]<br>
 (alias: <b>joinp</b>) Like <b>split-window</b>, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the
 space. This can be used to reverse <b>break-pane</b>.
 </p><p><b>kill-pane</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-pane]<br>
 (alias: <b>killp</b>) Destroy the given pane. If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also destroyed. The <b>-a</b> option kills all but the pane
 given with <b>-t</b>.
 </p><p><b>kill-window</b> [<b>-t</b> target-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>killw</b>) Kill the current window or the window at target-window, removing it from any sessions to which it is linked.
 </p><p><b>last-pane</b> [<b>-t</b> target-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>lastp</b>) Select the last (previously selected) pane.
 </p><p><b>last-window</b> [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 (alias: <b>last</b>) Select the last (previously selected) window. If no target-session is specified, select the last window of the current session.

 </p><p><b>link-window</b> [<b>-dk</b>] [<b>-s</b> src-window] [<b>-t</b> dst-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>linkw</b>) Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window. If dst-window is specified and no such window exists, the

 the newly linked window is not selected.
 </p><p><b>list-panes</b> [<b>-as</b>] [<b>-t</b> target]<br>
 (alias: <b>lsp</b>) If <b>-a</b> is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are listed. If <b>-s</b> is given, target is a session
 (or the current session). If neither is given, target is a window (or the current window).
 </p><p><b>list-windows</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 (alias: <b>lsw</b>) If <b>-a</b> is given, list all windows on the server. Otherwise, list windows in the current session or in target-session.

 (alias: <b>movew</b>) This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the window at src-window is moved to dst-window.
 </p><p><b>new-window</b> [<b>-adkP</b>] [<b>-n</b> window-name] [<b>-t</b> target-window] [shell-command]<br>
 (alias: <b>neww</b>) Create a new window. With <b>-a</b>, the new window is inserted at the next index up from the specified target-window, moving
 windows up if necessary, otherwise target-window is the new window location.
 </p><p>If <b>-d</b> is given, the session does not make the new window the current window. target-window represents the window to be created; if the target
 already exists an error is shown, unless the <b>-k</b> flag is used, in which case it is destroyed. shell-command is the command to execute. If
 shell-command is not specified, the value of the <b>default-command</b> option is used.
 </p><p>When the shell command completes, the window closes. See the <b>remain-on-exit</b> option to change this behaviour.
 </p><p>The TERM environment variable must be set to screen for all programs running inside <b>tmux</b>. New windows will automatically have
 TERM=screen added to their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files.
 </p><p>The <b>-P</b> option prints the location of the new window after it has been created.
 </p><p><b>next-layout</b> [<b>-t</b> target-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>nextl</b>) Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.
 </p><p><b>next-window</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>

 </p><p><b>pipe-pane</b> [<b>-o</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-pane] [shell-command]<br>
 (alias: <b>pipep</b>) Pipe any output sent by the program in target-pane to a shell command. A pane may only be piped to one command at a time, any
 existing pipe is closed before shell-command is executed. The shell-command string may contain the special character sequences supported by the
 <b>status-left</b> option. If no shell-command is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.
 </p><p>The <b>-o</b> option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:
 </p><p>bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o cat &gt;&gt;~/output.#I-#P
 </p>
 previous-layout [-t (alias: <b>prevl</b>) Move to the previous layout in the session.
 <p><b>previous-window</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 (alias: <b>prev</b>) Move to the previous window in the session. With <b>-a</b>, move to the previous window with a bell, activity or content alert.

 </p><p><b>rename-window</b> [<b>-t</b> target-window] new-name<br>
 (alias: <b>renamew</b>) Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if specified, to new-name.
 </p><p><b>resize-pane</b> [<b>-DLRU</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-pane] [adjustment]<br>
 (alias: <b>resizep</b>) Resize a pane, upward with <b>-U</b> (the default), downward with <b>-D</b>, to the left with <b>-L</b> and to the right with
 <b>-R</b>. The adjustment is given in lines or cells (the default is 1).
 </p><p><b>respawn-pane</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-pane] [shell-command]<br>
 (alias: <b>respawnp</b>) Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the <b>remain-on-exit</b> window option). If shell-command is not given,
 the command used when the pane was created is executed. The pane must be already inactive, unless <b>-k</b> is given, in which case any existing command is
 killed.
 </p><p><b>respawn-window</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-window] [shell-command]<br>
 (alias: <b>respawnw</b>) Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the <b>remain-on-exit</b> window option). If shell-command is not
 given, the command used when the window was created is executed. The window must be already inactive, unless <b>-k</b> is given, in which case any existing
 command is killed.
 </p><p><b>rotate-window</b> [<b>-DU</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>rotatew</b>) Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numerically lower) with <b>-U</b> or downward (numerically higher).

 </p><p><b>select-layout</b> [<b>-np</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-window] [layout-name]<br>
 (alias: <b>selectl</b>) Choose a specific layout for a window. If layout-name is not given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied. <b>-n</b>

 (alias: <b>selectp</b>) Make pane target-pane the active pane in window target-window. If one of <b>-D</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-R</b>, or <b>-U</b> is
 used, respectively the pane below, to the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used. <b>-l</b> is the same as using the <b>last-pane</b> command.

 </p><p><b>select-window</b> [<b>-lnp</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>selectw</b>) Select the window at target-window. <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b> and <b>-p</b> are equivalent to the <b>last-window</b>,
 <b>next-window</b> and <b>previous-window</b> commands.
 </p><p><b>split-window</b> [<b>-dhvP</b>] [<b><br>
 -l</b> size | <b>-p</b> percentage] [<b>-t</b> target-pane] [shell-command]<br>
 (alias: <b>splitw</b>) Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: <b>-h</b> does a horizontal split and <b>-v</b> a vertical split; if neither is
 specified, <b>-v</b> is assumed. The <b>-l</b> and <b>-p</b> options specify the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in cells (for horizontal
 split), or as a percentage, respectively. All other options have the same meaning as for the <b>new-window</b> command.
 </p><p><b>swap-pane</b> [<b>-dDU</b>] [<b>-s</b> src-pane] [<b>-t</b> dst-pane]<br>
 (alias: <b>swapp</b>) Swap two panes. If <b>-U</b> is used and no source pane is specified with <b>-s</b>, dst-pane is swapped with the previous pane
 (before it numerically); <b>-D</b> swaps with the next pane (after it numerically). <b>-d</b> instructs <b>tmux</b> not to change the active pane.

 </p><p><b>swap-window</b> [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-s</b> src-window] [<b>-t</b> dst-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>swapw</b>) This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the source and destination windows are swapped. It is an error if no window exists at
 src-window.
 </p><p><b>unlink-window</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>unlinkw</b>) Unlink target-window. Unless <b>-k</b> is given, a window may be unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows
 may not be linked to no sessions; if <b>-k</b> is specified and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed.
 </p><h2>Key Bindings</h2>

 <br><br><b>tmux</b> allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key. When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example A to
 Z). Ctrl keys may be prefixed with C- or ^, and Alt (meta) with M-. In addition, the following special key names are accepted: Up, Down,
 Left, Right, BSpace, BTab, DC (Delete), End, Enter, Escape, F1 to F20, Home,
 IC (Insert), NPage (Page Up), PPage (Page Down), Space, and Tab. Note that to bind the  or  keys, quotation marks are
 necessary, for example:bind-key  split-window
 bind-key  new-windowbind-key [-cnr] [-t (alias: <b>bind</b>) Bind key key to command. By default (without <b>-t</b>) the primary key bindings are modified (those normally activated
 with the prefix key); in this case, if <b>-n</b> is specified, it is not necessary to use the prefix key, command is bound to key alone. The
 <b>-r</b> flag indicates this key may repeat, see the <b>repeat-time</b> option.
 <p>If <b>-t</b> is present, key is bound in key-table: the binding for command mode with <b>-c</b> or for normal mode without. To view the
 default bindings and possible commands, see the <b>list-keys</b> command.
 </p><p><b>list-keys</b> [<b>-t</b> key-table]<br>
 (alias: <b>lsk</b>) List all key bindings. Without <b>-t</b> the primary key bindings - those executed when preceded by the prefix key - are printed. Keys
 bound without the prefix key (see <b>bind-key -n</b>) are marked with (no prefix).
 </p><p>With <b>-t</b>, the key bindings in key-table are listed; this may be one of: vi-edit, emacs-edit, vi-choice,
 emacs-choice, vi-copy or emacs-copy.
 </p><p><b>send-keys</b> [<b>-t</b> target-pane] key ...<br>
 (alias: <b>send</b>) Send a key or keys to a window. Each argument key is the name of the key (such as C-a or npage ) to send; if the string is not
 recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of characters. All arguments are sent sequentially from first to last.
 </p><p><b>send-prefix</b> [<b>-t</b> target-pane]<br>
 Send the prefix key to a window as if it was pressed. If multiple prefix keys are configured, only the first is sent.
 </p><p><b>unbind-key</b> [<b>-acn</b>] [<b>-t</b> key-table] key<br>
 (alias: <b>unbind</b>) Unbind the command bound to key. Without <b>-t</b> the primary key bindings are modified; in this case, if <b>-n</b> is
 specified, the command bound to key without a prefix (if any) is removed. If <b>-a</b> is present, all key bindings are removed.
 </p><p>If <b>-t</b> is present, key in key-table is unbound: the binding for command mode with <b>-c</b> or for normal mode without.

 </p><h2>Options</h2>

 <br><br>The appearance and behaviour of <b>tmux</b> may be modified by changing the value of various options. There are three types of option: server
 options, session options and window options.<br><br>The <b>tmux</b> server has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular window or session. These are altered with the <b>set-option -s</b>
 command, or displayed with the <b>show-options -s</b> command.<br><br>In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a separate set of global session options. Sessions which do not have a
 particular option configured inherit the value from the global session options. Session options are set or unset with the <b>set-option</b> command and may be
 listed with the <b>show-options</b> command. The available server and session options are listed under the <b>set-option</b> command.<br><br>Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there is a set of global window options from which any unset options are inherited.
 Window options are altered with the <b>set-window-option</b> command and can be listed with the <b>show-window-options</b> command. All window options are
 documented with the <b>set-window-option</b> command.<br><br>Commands which set options are as follows:set-option [-agsuw] [-t (alias: <b>set</b>) Set a window option with <b>-w</b> (equivalent to the <b>set-window-option</b> command), a server option with <b>-s</b>, otherwise a
 session option.
 <p>If <b>-g</b> is specified, the global session or window option is set. With <b>-a</b>, and if the option expects a string, value is appended to the
 existing setting. The <b>-u</b> flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from the global options. It is not possible to unset a global option.

 </p><p>Available window options are listed under <b>set-window-option</b>.
 </p><p>Available server options are:
 </p><p><b>buffer-limit</b> number<br>
 Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack, old ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum length.

 </p><p><b>set-clipboard</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the \e]52;...\007 <b><a href=xterm>xterm</a></b>(1) escape sequences. This option is on by default if there is an Ms entry in
 the <b><a href=/man/5/terminfo>terminfo</a></b>(5) description for the client terminal. Note that this feature needs to be enabled in <b><a href=xterm rel=nofollow>xterm</a></b>(1) by setting the resource:
 </p><p>disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop
 </p><p>Or changing this property from the <b><a href=xterm rel=nofollow>xterm</a></b>(1) interactive menu when required.
 </p>
 escape-time Set the time in milliseconds for which <b>tmux</b> waits after an escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or meta key sequences. The

 </p><p><b>bell-on-alert</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 If on, ring the terminal bell when an activity, content or silence alert occurs.
 </p><p><b>default-command</b> shell-command<br>
 Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the window is created) to shell-command, which may be any <b><a href=sh rel=nofollow>sh</a></b>(1) command. The default is an
 empty string, which instructs <b>tmux</b> to create a login shell using the value of the <b>default-shell</b> option.
 </p><p><b>default-path</b> path<br>
 Set the default working directory for processes created from keys, or interactively from the prompt. The default is empty, which means to use the working
 directory of the shell from which the server was started if it is available or the users home if not.
 </p><p><b>default-shell</b> path<br>
 Specify the default shell. This is used as the login shell for new windows when the <b>default-command</b> option is set to empty, and must be the full path of
 the executable. When started <b>tmux</b> tries to set a default value from the first suitable of the SHELL environment variable, the shell returned by
 <b><a href=/man/3/getpwuid>getpwuid</a></b>(3), or /bin/sh. This option should be configured when <b>tmux</b> is used as a login shell.
 </p><p><b>default-terminal</b> terminal<br>
 Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the default value of the TERM environment variable. For <b>tmux</b> to work correctly, this
 must be set to screen or a derivative of it.
 </p><p><b>destroy-unattached</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any clients, it is destroyed.
 </p><p><b>detach-on-destroy</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>

 Set the amount of time for which status line messages and other on-screen indicators are displayed. time is in milliseconds.
 </p><p><b>history-limit</b> lines<br>
 Set the maximum number of lines held in window history. This setting applies only to new windows - existing window histories are not resized and retain the
 limit at the point they were created.
 </p><p><b>lock-after-time</b> number<br>
 Lock the session (like the <b>lock-session</b> command) after number seconds of inactivity, or the entire server (all sessions) if the
 <b>lock-server</b> option is set. The default is not to lock (set to 0).
 </p><p><b>lock-command</b> shell-command<br>
 Command to run when locking each client. The default is to run <b>lock</b>(1) with <b>-np</b>.
 </p><p><b>lock-server</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 If this option is <b>on</b> (the default), instead of each session locking individually as each has been idle for <b>lock-after-time</b>, the entire server
 will lock after all sessions would have locked. This has no effect as a session option; it must be set as a global option.
 </p><p><b>message-attr</b> attributes<br>

 command to destroy it.
 </p><p><b>set-titles</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Attempt to set the window title using the \e]2;...\007 xterm code if the terminal appears to be an xterm. This option is off by default. Note that elinks will
 only attempt to set the window title if the STY environment variable is set.
 </p><p><b>set-titles-string</b> string<br>

 </p>

 <br><br><b>Character pair Replaced with</b><br><br>#(shell-command) First line of the commands output<br><br>#[attributes] Colour or attribute change<br><br>#H Hostname of local host<br><br>#h Hostname of local host without the domain name<br><br>#F Current window flag<br><br>#I Current window index<br><br>#P Current pane index<br><br>#S Session name<br><br>#T Current window title<br><br>#W Current window name<br><br>## A literal #
 The #(shell-command) form executes shell-command and inserts the first line of its output. Note that shell commands are only executed once at the interval
 specified by the <b>status-interval</b> option: if the status line is redrawn in the meantime, the previous result is used. Shell commands are executed with
 the <b>tmux</b> global environment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).
 <p>The window title (#T) is the title set by the program running within the window using the OSC title setting sequence, for example:
 </p>$ printf \033]2;My Title\033\\When a window is first created, its title is the hostname.
 <p>#[attributes] allows a comma-separated list of attributes to be specified, these may be fg=colour to set the foreground colour, bg=colour to set the
 background colour, the name of one of the attributes (listed under the <b>message-attr</b> option) to turn an attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with no
 to turn one off, for example <b>nobright</b>. Examples are:
 </p>#(sysctl vm.loadavg)
 #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]Where appropriate, special character sequences may be prefixed with a number to specify the maximum length, for example #24T.
 <p>By default, UTF-8 in string is not interpreted, to enable UTF-8, use the <b>status-utf8</b> option.
 </p>
 status-left-attr Set the attribute of the left part of the status line.
 <p><b>status-left-bg</b> colour<br>
 Set the background colour of the left part of the status line.

 characters. This option defaults to off.
 </p><p><b>terminal-overrides</b> string<br>
 Contains a list of entries which override terminal descriptions read using <b><a href=/man/5/terminfo rel=nofollow>terminfo</a></b>(5). string is a comma-separated list of items each a colon-separated
 string made up of a terminal type pattern (matched using <b><a href=/man/3/fnmatch rel=nofollow>fnmatch</a></b>(3)) and a set of name=value entries.
 </p><p>For example, to set the clear <b><a href=/man/5/terminfo rel=nofollow>terminfo</a></b>(5) entry to \e[H\e[2J for all terminal types and the dch1 entry to \e[P for the rxvt terminal type, the
 option could be set to the string:
 </p><p>*:clear=\e[H\e[2J,rxvt:dch1=\e[P
 </p><p>The terminal entry value is passed through <b>strunvis</b>(3) before interpretation. The default value forcibly corrects the colors entry for terminals which
 support 88 or 256 colours:
 </p>*88col*:colors=88,*256col*:colors=256,xterm*:XT
 update-environment Set a space-separated string containing a list of environment variables to be copied into the session environment when a new session is created or an

 </p><p><b>visual-bell</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 If this option is on, a message is shown on a bell instead of it being passed through to the terminal (which normally makes a sound). Also see the
 <b>bell-action</b> option.
 </p><p><b>visual-content</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Like <b>visual-activity</b>, display a message when content is present in a window for which the <b>monitor-content</b> window option is enabled.

 </p><p><b>visual-silence</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 If <b>monitor-silence</b> is enabled, prints a message after the interval has expired on a given window.
 </p><p><b>set-window-option</b> [<b>-agu</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-window] option value<br>
 (alias: <b>setw</b>) Set a window option. The <b>-a</b>, <b>-g</b> and <b>-u</b> flags work similarly to the <b>set-option</b> command.
 </p><p>Supported window options are:
 </p><p><b>aggressive-resize</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Aggressively resize the chosen window. This means that <b>tmux</b> will resize the window to the size of the smallest session for which it is the current
 window, rather than the smallest session to which it is attached. The window may resize when the current window is changed on another sessions; this option is
 good for full-screen programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs such as shells.
 </p><p><b>alternate-screen</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 This option configures whether programs running inside <b>tmux</b> may use the terminal alternate screen feature, which allows the smcup and
 rmcup <b><a href=/man/5/terminfo rel=nofollow>terminfo</a></b>(5) capabilities. The alternate screen feature preserves the contents of the window when an interactive application starts and restores it
 on exit, so that any output visible before the application starts reappears unchanged after it exits. The default is on.
 </p><p><b>automatic-rename</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Control automatic window renaming. When this setting is enabled, <b>tmux</b> will attempt - on supported platforms - to rename the window to reflect the
 command currently running in it. This flag is automatically disabled for an individual window when a name is specified at creation with <b>new-window</b> or
 <b>new-session</b>, or later with <b>rename-window</b>. It may be switched off globally with:
 </p><p>set-window-option -g automatic-rename off
 </p>
 clock-mode-colour Set clock colour.
 <p><b>clock-mode-style</b> [<b>12</b> | <b>24</b>]<br>
 Set clock hour format.
 </p><p><b>force-height</b> height<b><br>
 force-width</b> width<br>
 Prevent <b>tmux</b> from resizing a window to greater than width or height. A value of zero restores the default unlimited setting.

 </p><p><b>main-pane-height</b> height<b><br>
 main-pane-width</b> width<br>
 Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane in the <b>main-horizontal</b> or <b>main-vertical</b> layouts.
 </p><p><b>mode-attr</b> attributes<br>
 Set window modes attributes.
 </p><p><b>mode-bg</b> colour<br>
 Set window modes background colour.
 </p><p><b>mode-fg</b> colour<br>
 Set window modes foreground colour.
 </p><p><b>mode-keys</b> [<b>vi</b> | <b>emacs</b>]<br>
 Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy and choice modes. As with the <b>status-keys</b> option, the default is emacs, unless VISUAL or EDITOR contains
 vi.
 </p><p><b>mode-mouse</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Mouse state in modes. If on, the mouse may be used to enter copy mode and copy a selection by dragging, to enter copy mode and scroll with the mouse wheel, or
 to select an option in choice mode.
 </p><p><b>monitor-activity</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Monitor for activity in the window. Windows with activity are highlighted in the status line.
 </p><p><b>monitor-content</b> match-string<br>
 Monitor content in the window. When <b><a href=/man/3/fnmatch rel=nofollow>fnmatch</a></b>(3) pattern match-string appears in the window, it is highlighted in the status line.
 </p><p><b>monitor-silence</b> [<b>interval</b>]<br>
 Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within <b>interval</b> seconds. Windows that have been silent for the interval are highlighted in the status
 line. An interval of zero disables the monitoring.
 </p><p><b>other-pane-height</b> height<br>
 Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane) in the <b>main-horizontal</b> layout. If this option is set to 0 (the default), it will have no effect.
 If both the <b>main-pane-height</b> and <b>other-pane-height</b> options are set, the main pane will grow taller to make the other panes the specified height,
 but will never shrink to do so.
 </p><p><b>other-pane-width</b> width<br>
 Like <b>other-pane-height</b>, but set the width of other panes in the <b>main-vertical</b> layout.
 </p><p><b>remain-on-exit</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 A window with this flag set is not destroyed when the program running in it exits. The window may be reactivated with the <b>respawn-window</b> command.

 </p><p><b>synchronize-panes</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Duplicate input to any pane to all other panes in the same window (only for panes that are not in any special mode).
 </p><p><b>utf8</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 Instructs <b>tmux</b> to expect UTF-8 sequences to appear in this window.
 </p><p><b>window-status-attr</b> attributes<br>
 Set status line attributes for a single window.
 </p><p><b>window-status-bg</b> colour<br>
 Set status line background colour for a single window.
 </p><p><b>window-status-fg</b> colour<br>
 Set status line foreground colour for a single window.
 </p><p><b>window-status-format</b> string<br>
 Set the format in which the window is displayed in the status line window list. See the status-left option for details of special character sequences
 available. The default is #I:#W#F.
 </p><p><b>window-status-alert-attr</b> attributes<br>
 Set status line attributes for windows which have an alert (bell, activity or content).
 </p><p><b>window-status-alert-bg</b> colour<br>
 Set status line background colour for windows with an alert.
 </p><p><b>window-status-alert-fg</b> colour<br>
 Set status line foreground colour for windows with an alert.
 </p><p><b>window-status-current-attr</b> attributes<br>
 Set status line attributes for the currently active window.
 </p><p><b>window-status-current-bg</b> colour<br>
 Set status line background colour for the currently active window.
 </p><p><b>window-status-current-fg</b> colour<br>
 Set status line foreground colour for the currently active window.
 </p><p><b>window-status-current-format</b> string<br>
 Like window-status-format, but is the format used when the window is the current window.
 </p><p><b>word-separators</b> string<br>
 Sets the windows conception of what characters are considered word separators, for the purposes of the next and previous word commands in copy mode. The
 default is  -_@.
 </p><p><b>xterm-keys</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]<br>
 If this option is set, <b>tmux</b> will generate <b><a href=xterm rel=nofollow>xterm</a></b>(1) -style function key sequences; these have a number included to indicate modifiers such as Shift, Alt
 or Ctrl. The default is off.
 </p><p><b>show-options</b> [<b>-gsw</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-session | target-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>show</b>) Show the window options with <b>-w</b> (equivalent to <b>show-window-options</b>), the server options with <b>-s</b>, otherwise the
 session options for target session. Global session or window options are listed if <b>-g</b> is used.
 </p><p><b>show-window-options</b> [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-window]<br>
 (alias: <b>showw</b>) List the window options for target-window, or the global window options if <b>-g</b> is used.
 </p><h2>Environment</h2>

 <br><br>When the server is started, <b>tmux</b> copies the environment into the global environment; in addition, each session has a session
 environment. When a window is created, the session and global environments are merged. If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment
 is used. The result is the initial environment passed to the new process.<br><br>The <b>update-environment</b> session option may be used to update the session environment from the client when a new session is created or an old
 reattached. <b>tmux</b> also initialises the TMUX variable with some internal information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM variable
 with the correct terminal setting of screen.<br><br>Commands to alter and view the environment are:set-environment [-gru] [-t (alias: <b>setenv</b>) Set or unset an environment variable. If <b>-g</b> is used, the change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to
 the session environment for target-session. The <b>-u</b> flag unsets a variable. <b>-r</b> indicates the variable is to be removed from the environment
 before starting a new process.
 <p><b>show-environment</b> [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-t</b> target-session]<br>
 (alias: <b>showenv</b>) Display the environment for target-session or the global environment with <b>-g</b>. Variables removed from the environment are
 prefixed with -.
 </p><h2>Status Line</h2>

 <br><br><b>tmux</b> includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each terminal. By default, the status line is enabled (it may be
 disabled with the <b>status</b> session option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current session in square brackets; the window list; the
 current window title in double quotes; and the time and date.<br><br>The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a shell
 command, see the <b>status-left</b>, <b>status-left-length</b>, <b>status-right</b>, and <b>status-right-length</b> options below), and a central window list.
 By default, the window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the windows present in the current session in ascending numerical order. It may be
 customised with the window-status-format and window-status-current-format options. The flag is one of the following symbols appended to the
 window name:
 Symbol Meaning
 * Denotes the current window.
 - Marks the last window (previously selected).
 # Window is monitored and activity has been detected.
 ! A bell has occurred in the window.
 + Window is monitored for content and it has appeared.
 ~ The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
 <br><br>The # symbol relates to the <b>monitor-activity</b> and + to the <b>monitor-content</b> window options. The window name is printed in inverted colours if an
 alert (bell, activity or content) is present.<br><br>The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status line using the <b>status-attr</b>, <b>status-fg</b> and <b>status-bg</b>
 session options and individual windows using the <b>window-status-attr</b>, <b>window-status-fg</b> and <b>window-status-bg</b> window options.<br><br>The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be controlled with the <b>status-interval</b> session option.<br><br>Commands related to the status line are as follows:
 command-prompt [-I -p -t Open the command prompt in a client. This may be used from inside <b>tmux</b> to execute commands interactively.
 <p>If template is specified, it is used as the command. If present, <b>-I</b> is a comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt. If
 <b>-p</b> is given, prompts is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from
 template if it is present, or : if not.
 </p><p>Both inputs and prompts may contain the special character sequences supported by the <b>status-left</b> option.
 </p><p>Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string %% and all occurrences of %1 are replaced by the response to the first prompt, the
 second %% and all %2 are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for further prompts. Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced (<br>
 %1 to %9).
 </p><p><b>confirm-before</b> [<b>-p</b> prompt] [<b>-t</b> target-client] command<br>
 (alias: <b>confirm</b>) Ask for confirmation before executing command. If <b>-p</b> is given, prompt is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt
 is constructed from command. It may contain the special character sequences supported by the <b>status-left</b> option.
 </p><p>This command works only from inside <b>tmux</b>.
 </p><p><b>display-message</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-c</b> target-client] [<b>-t</b> target-pane] [message]<br>
 (alias: <b>display</b>) Display a message. If <b>-p</b> is given, the output is printed to stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the target-client status
 line. The format of message is as for <b>status-left</b>, with the exception that #() are not handled; information is taken from target-pane if
 <b>-t</b> is given, otherwise the active pane for the session attached to target-client.
 </p><h2>Buffers</h2>

 <br><br><b>tmux</b> maintains a stack of paste buffers. Up to the value of the <b>buffer-limit</b> option are kept; when a new buffer is added, the buffer at
 the bottom of the stack is removed. Buffers may be added using <b>copy-mode</b> or the <b>set-buffer</b> command, and pasted into a window using the
 <b>paste-buffer</b> command.<br><br>A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window. By default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the <b>history-limit</b>
 option (see the <b>set-option</b> command above).<br><br>The buffer commands are as follows:choose-buffer [-t Put a window into buffer choice mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from a list. After a buffer is selected, %% is replaced by the buffer
 index in template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, paste-buffer -b %% is used. This command works only from
 inside <b>tmux</b>.
 <p><b>clear-history</b> [<b>-t</b> target-pane]<br>
 (alias: <b>clearhist</b>) Remove and free the history for the specified pane.
 </p><p><b>delete-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> buffer-index]<br>
 (alias: <b>deleteb</b>) Delete the buffer at buffer-index, or the top buffer if not specified.
 </p><p><b>list-buffers</b><br>
 (alias: <b>lsb</b>) List the global buffers.
 </p><p><b>load-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> buffer-index] path<br>
 (alias: <b>loadb</b>) Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from path.
 </p><p><b>paste-buffer</b> [<b>-dr</b>] [<b>-b</b> buffer-index] [<b>-s</b> separator] [<b>-t</b> target-pane]<br>
 (alias: <b>pasteb</b>) Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane. If not specified, paste into the current one. With <b>-d</b>, also delete
 the paste buffer from the stack. When output, any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced with a separator, by default carriage return (CR).
 A custom separator may be specified using the <b>-s</b> flag. The <b>-r</b> flag means to do no replacement (equivalent to a separator of LF).

 </p><p><b>save-buffer</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b</b> buffer-index] path<br>
 (alias: <b>saveb</b>) Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path. The <b>-a</b> option appends to rather than overwriting the file.

 </p><p><b>set-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> buffer-index] data<br>
 (alias: <b>setb</b>) Set the contents of the specified buffer to data.
 </p><p><b>show-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> buffer-index]<br>
 (alias: <b>showb</b>) Display the contents of the specified buffer.
 </p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

 <br><br>Miscellaneous commands are as follows:clock-mode [-t Display a large clock.
 <p><b>if-shell</b> shell-command command<br>
 (alias: <b>if</b>) Execute command if shell-command returns success.
 </p><p><b>lock-server</b><br>
 (alias: <b>lock</b>) Lock each client individually by running the command specified by the <b>lock-command</b> option.
 </p><p><b>run-shell</b> shell-command<br>
 (alias: <b>run</b>) Execute shell-command in the background without creating a window. After it finishes, any output to stdout is displayed in copy
 mode. If the command doesnt return success, the exit status is also displayed.
 </p><p><b>server-info</b><br>
 (alias: <b>info</b>) Show server information and terminal details.
 </p><h2>Terminfo Extensions</h2>

 <br><br><b>tmux</b> understands some extensions to <b><a href=/man/5/terminfo rel=nofollow>terminfo</a></b>(5):       CcSet the cursor colour. The first takes a single string argument and is used to set the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the default cursor
 colour. If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor colour from inside <b>tmux</b>:
 <p>$ printf \033]12;red\033\\
 </p>
 Change the cursor style. If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor to an underline:
 <p>$ printf \033[4 q
 </p><p>If Csr is set, it will be used to reset the cursor style instead of Cs.

 <br><br>If any list request option is specified, other list requests must be specifically requested - e.g., if <b>-U</b> is specified for the listing of UNIX
 socket files, NFS files wont be listed unless <b>-N</b> is also specified; or if a user list is specified with the <b>-u</b> option, UNIX domain socket files,
 belonging to users not in the list, wont be listed unless the <b>-U</b> option is also specified.<br><br>Normally list options that are specifically stated are ORed - i.e., specifying the <b>-i</b> option without an address and the <b>-u</b>foo option
 produces a listing of all network files OR files belonging to processes owned by user foo. The exceptions are:
 -u option;-p option;-g option;-c option;-s <br><br>Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.<br><br>The <b>-a</b> option may be used to AND the selections. For example, specifying <b>-a</b>, <b>-U</b>, and <b>-u</b>foo produces a listing of only UNIX
 socket files that belong to processes owned by user foo.<br><br>Caution: the <b>-a</b> option causes all list selection options to be ANDed; it cant be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options
 by placing it between them, even though its placement there is acceptable. Wherever <b>-a</b> is placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection options.<br><br>Items of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors, network addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names, security
 contexts - are joined in a single ORed set and applied before the result participates in ANDing. Thus, for example, specifying <b>-i</b>@aaa.bbb,
 <b>-i</b>@ccc.ddd, <b>-a</b>, and <b>-u</b>fff,ggg will select the listing of files that belong to either login fff OR ggg AND have network connections
 to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.<br><br>Options may be grouped together following a single prefix -- e.g., the option set <b>-a -b -C</b> may be stated as <b>-abC</b>. However, since
 values are optional following <b>+|-f</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>+|-L</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>+|-r</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-S</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-x</b> and
 <b>-z</b>. when you have no values for them be careful that the following character isnt ambiguous. For example, <b>-Fn</b> might represent the <b>-F</b> and
 <b>-n</b> options, or it might represent the <b>n</b> field identifier character following the <b>-F</b> option. When ambiguity is possible, start a new option
 with a - character - e.g., <b>-F -n</b>. If the next option is a file name, follow the possibly ambiguous option with -- - e.g., <b>-F --
 name</b>.<br><br>Either the + or the - prefix may be applied to a group of options. Options that dont take on separate meanings for each prefix - e.g., <b>-i</b>
 - may be grouped under either prefix. Thus, for example, +M -i may be stated as +Mi and the group means the same as the separate options. Be careful of
 prefix grouping when one or more options in the group does take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g., <b>+|-M</b>; -iM is not the same
 request as -i +M. When in doubt, use separate options with appropriate prefixes.
 -? -h
 These two equivalent options select a usage (help) output list. Lsof displays a shortened form of this output when it detects an error in the
 options supplied to it, after it has displayed messages explaining each error. (Escape the ? character as your shell requires.)-a
 This option causes list selection options to be ANDed, as described above.-A This option is available on systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel code is implemented via dynamic modules. It allows the lsof user to
 specify A as an alternate name list file where the kernel addresses of the dynamic modules might be found. See the lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b>
 section gives its location.) for more information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they affect lsof.-b
 This option causes lsof to avoid kernel functions that might block - <b><a href=/man/2/lstat>lstat</a></b>(2), <b><a href=/man/2/readlink>readlink</a></b>(2), and <b><a href=/man/2/stat>stat</a></b>(2).See the
 <b>BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS</b> and <b>AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS</b> sections for information on using this option.-ccThis option selects the listing of files for processes executing the command that begins with the characters of c. Multiple commands may be
 specified, using multiple <b>-c</b> options. They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.If
 c begins with a ^, then the following characters specify a command name whose processes are to be ignored (excluded.)If
 c begins and ends with a slash (/), the characters between the slashes are interpreted as a regular expression. Shell meta-characters in the
 regular expression must be quoted to prevent their interpretation by the shell. The closing slash may be followed by these modifiers:<br>   b    the regular expression is a basic one.    i    ignore the case of letters.    x    the regular expression is an extended one        (default).
 See the lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information on basic and extended regular expressions.The simple command specification is tested first.
 If that test fails, the command regular expression is applied. If the simple command test succeeds, the command regular expression test isnt made. This
 may result in no command found for regex: messages when lsofs <b>-V</b> option is specified.+c This option defines the maximum number of initial characters of the name, supplied by the UNIX dialect, of the UNIX command associated with a process to be
 printed in the COMMAND column. (The lsof default is nine.)Note that many UNIX dialects do not supply all command name characters
 to lsof in the files and structures from which lsof obtains command name. Often dialects limit the number of characters supplied in those
 sources. For example, Linux 2.4.27 and Solaris 9 both limit command name length to 16 characters.If
 w is zero (0), all command characters supplied to lsof by the UNIX dialect will be printed.If
 w is less than the length of the column title, COMMAND, it will be raised to that length.-C
 This option disables the reporting of any path name components from the kernels name cache. See the <b>KERNEL NAME CACHE</b> section for more information.+d This option causes lsof to search for all open instances of directory s and the files and directories it contains at its top level. This
 option does NOT descend the directory tree, rooted at s. The <b>+D</b> D option may be used to request a full-descent directory tree search,
 rooted at directory D.Processing of the
 <b>+d</b> option does not follow symbolic links within s unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x  l</b> option is also specified. Nor does it search for
 open files on file system mount points on subdirectories of s unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x  f</b> option is also specified.Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to searching for
 files that the user has permission to examine with the system <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2) function.-d This option specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or include in the output listing. The file descriptors are specified in the
 comma-separated set s - e.g., cwd,1,3, ^6,^2. (There should be no spaces in the set.)The list is an exclusion list if all entries of the set begin with ^.
 It is an inclusion list if no entry begins with ^. Mixed lists are not permitted.A file descriptor number range may be in the set as long as
 neither member is empty, both members are numbers, and the ending member is larger than the starting one - e.g., 0-7 or 3-10. Ranges may be
 specified for exclusion if they have the ^ prefix - e.g., ^0-7 excludes all file descriptors 0 through 7.Multiple file descriptor numbers are joined in a single ORed set before
 participating in AND option selection.When there are exclusion and inclusion members in the set,
 lsof reports them as errors and exits with a non-zero return code.See the description of File Descriptor (FD) output values in the
 <b>OUTPUT</b> section for more information on file descriptor names.+D This option causes lsof to search for all open instances of directory D and all the files and directories it contains to its complete depth.Processing of the
 <b>+D</b> option does not follow symbolic links within D unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x  l</b> option is also specified. Nor does it search for
 open files on file system mount points on subdirectories of D unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x  f</b> option is also specified.Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to searching for
 files that the user has permission to examine with the system <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2) function.Further note:
 lsof may process this option slowly and require a large amount of dynamic memory to do it. This is because it must descend the entire directory
 tree, rooted at D, calling <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2) for each file and directory, building a list of all the files it finds, and searching that list for a match
 with every open file. When directory D is large, these steps can take a long time, so use this option prudently.-D This option directs lsofs use of the device cache file. The use of this option is sometimes restricted. See the <b>DEVICE CACHE FILE</b> section
 and the sections that follow it for more information on this option.-D
 must be followed by a function letter; the function letter may optionally be followed by a path name. Lsof recognizes these function letters:<br>   ? - report device cache file paths    b - build the device cache file    i - ignore the device cache file    r - read the
 device cache file    u - read and update the device cache file
 The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions, accompanied by a path name, are sometimes restricted. When these functions are restricted, they will not
 appear in the description of the <b>-D</b> option that accompanies <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option output. See the <b>DEVICE CACHE FILE</b> section and the
 sections that follow it for more information on these functions and when theyre restricted.The
 <b>?</b> function reports the read-only and write paths that lsof can use for the device cache file, the names of any environment variables whose values
 lsof will examine when forming the device cache file path, and the format for the personal device cache file path. (Escape the ? character as your
 shell requires.)When available, the
 <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions may be followed by the device cache files path. The standard default is .lsof_hostname in the home
 directory of the real user ID that executes lsof, but this could have been changed when lsof was configured and compiled. (The output of the
 <b>-h</b> and <b>-?</b> options show the current default prefix - e.g., .lsof.) The suffix, hostname, is the first component of the hosts name
 returned by <b><a href=/man/2/gethostname>gethostname</a></b>(2).When available, the
 <b>b</b> function directs lsof to build a new device cache file at the default or specified path.The
 <b>i</b> function directs lsof to ignore the default device cache file and obtain its information about devices via direct calls to the kernel.The
 <b>r</b> function directs lsof to read the device cache at the default or specified path, but prevents it from creating a new device cache file when
 none exists or the existing one is improperly structured. The <b>r</b> function, when specified without a path name, prevents lsof from updating an
 incorrect or outdated device cache file, or creating a new one in its place. The <b>r</b> function is always available when it is specified without a path name
 argument; it may be restricted by the permissions of the lsof process.When available, the
 <b>u</b> function directs lsof to read the device cache file at the default or specified path, if possible, and to rebuild it, if necessary. This is
 the default device cache file function when no <b>-D</b> option has been specified.+|-e exempts the file system whose path name is s from being subjected to kernel function calls that might block. The <b>+e</b> option exempts
 <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2), <b><a href=/man/2/lstat rel=nofollow>lstat</a></b>(2) and most <b><a href=/man/2/readlink rel=nofollow>readlink</a></b>(2) kernel function calls. The <b>-e</b> option exempts only <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2) and <b><a href=/man/2/lstat rel=nofollow>lstat</a></b>(2) kernel
 function calls. Multiple file systems may be specified with separate <b>+|-e</b> specifications and each may have <b><a href=/man/2/readlink rel=nofollow>readlink</a></b>(2) calls exempted or not.This option is currently implemented only for Linux.
 CAUTION:
 this option can easily be mis-applied to other than the file system of interest, because it uses path name rather than the more reliable device and inode
 numbers. (Device and inode numbers are acquired via the potentially blocking <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2) kernel call and are thus not available, but see the <b>+|-m</b>
 m option as a possible alternative way to supply device numbers.)Use this option with great care and fully specify the path name of the
 file system to be exempted. Consider, for example, that specifying -e / would exempt all file systems, since all their paths begin with a /.When open files on exempted file systems are reported, it is not
 possible to obtain all their information. Therefore, some information columns will be blank, the characters UNKN preface the values in the TYPE column,
 and the applicable exemption option is added in parentheses to the end of the NAME column. Some device number information might be made available via the
 <b>+|-m</b> m option.+|-f [cfgGn]
 <b>f</b> by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be interpreted. When followed by <b>c</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, or <b>n</b> in any
 combination it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure information is to be enabled (+) or inhibited (-).Normally a path name argument is taken to be a file system name if
 it matches a mounted-on directory name reported by <b><a href=mount>mount</a></b>(8), or if it represents a block device, named in the mount output and associated
 with a mounted directory name. When <b>+f</b> is specified, all path name arguments will be taken to be file system names, and lsof will complain if any
 are not. This can be useful, for example, when the file system name (mounted-on device) isnt a block device. This happens for some CD-ROM file systems.When
 <b>-f</b> is specified by itself, all path name arguments will be taken to be simple files. Thus, for example, the <b>-f</b> -- / arguments direct lsof
 to search for open files with a / path name, not all open files in the / (root) file system.Be careful to make sure
 <b>+f</b> and <b>-f</b> are properly terminated and arent followed by a character (e.g., of the file or file system name) that might be taken as a
 parameter. For example, use -- after <b>+f</b> and <b>-f</b> as in these examples.<br>   $ The listing of information from kernel file structures, requested with the <b>+f [cfgGn]</b> option form, is normally inhibited, and is not available in
 whole or part for some dialects - e.g., /proc-based Linux kernels below 2.6.22. When the prefix to <b>f</b> is a plus sign (+), these characters request file
 structure information:<br>   c    file structure use count (not Linux)    f    file structure address (not Linux)    g    file flag abbreviations (Linux 2.6.22
 and up)    G    file flags in hexadecimal (Linux 2.6.22 and up)    n    file structure node address (not Linux)
 When the prefix is minus (-) the same characters disable the listing of the indicated values.File structure addresses, use counts, flags, and node addresses may be
 used to detect more readily identical files inherited by child processes and identical files in use by different processes. Lsof column output can
 be sorted by output columns holding the values and listed to identify identical file use, or lsof field output can be parsed by an AWK or Perl
 post-filter script, or by a C program.-F This option specifies a character list, f, that selects the fields to be output for processing by another program, and the character that terminates
 each output field. Each field to be output is specified with a single character in f. The field terminator defaults to NL, but may be changed to NUL
 (000). See the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> section for a description of the field identification characters and the field output process.When the field selection character list is empty, all standard fields are
 selected (except the raw device field, security context and zone field for compatibility reasons) and the NL field terminator is used.When the field selection character list contains only a zero (0),
 all fields are selected (except the raw device field for compatibility reasons) and the NUL terminator character is used.Other combinations of fields and their associated field terminator
 character must be set with explicit entries in f, as described in the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> section.When a field selection character identifies an item
 lsof does not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected with <b>-R</b> - specification of the field character - e.g., <b>-FR</b> - also selects the
 listing of the item.When the field selection character list contains the single
 character ?, lsof will display a help list of the field identification characters. (Escape the ? character as your shell requires.)-g This option excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process group IDentification (PGID) numbers are in the
 comma-separated set s - e.g., 123 or 123,^456. (There should be no spaces in the set.)PGID numbers that begin with ^ (negation) represent exclusions.
 in AND option selection. However, PGID exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before other selection criteria are applied.The
 <b>-g</b> option also enables the output display of PGID numbers. When specified without a PGID set thats all it does.-i This option selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in i. If no address is specified, this option
 selects the listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX) network files.If
 <b>-i</b>4 or <b>-i</b>6 is specified with no following address, only files of the indicated IP version, IPv4 or IPv6, are displayed. (An
 IPv6 specification may be used only if the dialects supports IPv6, as indicated by [46] and IPv[46] in lsofs <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> output.)
 Sequentially specifying <b>-i</b>4, followed by <b>-i</b>6 is the same as specifying <b>-i</b>, and vice-versa. Specifying <b>-i</b>4, or <b>-i</b>6 after
 <b>-i</b> is the same as specifying <b>-i</b>4 or <b>-i</b>6 by itself.Multiple addresses (up to a limit of 100) may be specified with multiple
 <b>-i</b> options. (A port number or service name range is counted as one address.) They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option
 selection.An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in square
 brackets are optional.):[46 specifies the IP version, IPv4 or IPv6

         that applies to the following address.

         6 may be be specified only if the UNIX

         dialect supports IPv6.  If neither 4 nor

         6 is specified, the following address

         applies to all IP versions.

     protocol is a protocol name - TCP, UDP

     hostname is an Internet host name.  Unless a

         specific IP version is specified, open

         network files associated with host names

         of all versions will be selected.

     hostaddr is a numeric Internet IPv4 address in

         dot form; or an IPv6 numeric address in

         colon form, enclosed in brackets, if the

         UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  When an IP

         version is selected, only its numeric

         addresses may be specified.

     service is an /etc/services name - e.g., smtp -
         or a list of them.

     port is a port number, or a list of them.IPv6 options may be used only if the UNIX dialect supports IPv6.
 To see if the dialect supports IPv6, run lsof and specify the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> (help) option. If the displayed description of the <b>-i</b>
 option contains [46] and IPv[46], IPv6 is supported.IPv4 host names and addresses may not be specified if network file selection
 is limited to IPv6 with <b>-i</b> 6. IPv6 host names and addresses may not be specified if network file selection is limited to IPv4 with <b>-i</b> 4. When
 an open IPv4 network files address is mapped in an IPv6 address, the open files type will be IPv6, not IPv4, and its display will be selected by 6, not
 4.At least one address component -
 <b>4, 6,</b> protocol, ,IR hostname , hostaddr, or service - must be supplied. The @ character, leading the host
 specification, is always required; as is the :, leading the port specification. Specify either hostname or hostaddr. Specify either
 service name list or port number list. If a service name list is specified, the protocol may also need to be specified if the TCP,
 UDP and UDPLITE port numbers for the service name are different. Use any case - lower or upper - for protocol.Servicenames and port numbers may be combined in a list whose entries are separated by commas and whose numeric range entries are separated by minus signs.
 There may be no embedded spaces, and all service names must belong to the specified protocol. Since service names may contain embedded minus signs, the
 starting entry of a range cant be a service name; it can be a port number, however.Here are some sample addresses:
 -i6 - IPv6 only

     TCP:25 - TCP and port 25

     @1.2.3.4 - Internet IPv4 host address 1.2.3.4

     @[3ffe:1ebc::1]:1234 - Internet IPv6 host address
         3ffe:1ebc::1, port 1234

     UDP:who - UDP who service port

     TCP@lsof.itap:513 - TCP, port 513 and host name lsof.itap

     tcp@foo:1-10,smtp,99 - TCP, ports 1 through 10,
         service name smtp, port 99, host name foo

     tcp@bar:1-smtp - TCP, ports 1 through smtp, host bar

     :time - either TCP, UDP or UDPLITE time service port-k This option specifies a kernel name list file, k, in place of /vmunix, /mach, etc. This option is not available under AIX on the IBM RISC/System
 6000.-l
 This option inhibits the conversion of user ID numbers to login names. It is also useful when login name lookup is working improperly or slowly.+|-L This option enables (+) or disables (-) the listing of file link counts, where they are available - e.g., they arent available for sockets, or most
 FIFOs and pipes.When
 <b>+L</b> is specified without a following number, all link counts will be listed. When <b>-L</b> is specified (the default), no link counts will be
 listed.When
 <b>+L</b> is followed by a number, only files having a link count less than that number will be listed. (No number may follow <b>-L</b>.) A specification
 of the form <b>+L1</b> will select open files that have been unlinked. A specification of the form <b>+aL1 &lt;file_system&gt;</b> will select
 unlinked open files on the specified file system.For other link count comparisons, use field output (-F)
 and a post-processing script or program.+|-m This option specifies an alternate kernel memory file or activates mount table supplement processing.The option form
 <b>-m</b> m specifies a kernel memory file, m, in place of /dev/kmem or /dev/mem - e.g., a crash dump file.The option form
 <b>+m</b> requests that a mount supplement file be written to the standard output file. All other options are silently ignored.There will be a line in the mount supplement file for each mounted file
 system, containing the mounted file system directory, followed by a single space, followed by the device number in hexadecimal 0x format - e.g.,<br>   / 0x801
 Lsof can use the mount supplement file to get device numbers for file systems when it cant get them via <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2) or <b><a href=/man/2/lstat rel=nofollow>lstat</a></b>(2).The option form
 <b>+m</b> m identifies m as a mount supplement file.Note: the
 <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b> m options are not available for all supported dialects. Check the output of lsofs <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> options to
 see if the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b> m options are available.+|-M
 Enables (<b>+</b>) or disables (<b>-</b>) the reporting of portmapper registrations for local TCP, UDP and UDPLITE ports. The default reporting mode is set
 by the lsof builder with the HASPMAPENABLED #define in the dialects machine.h header file; lsof is distributed with the HASPMAPENABLED #define
 deactivated, so portmapper reporting is disabled by default and must be requested with <b>+M</b>. Specifying lsofs <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option will
 report the default mode. Disabling portmapper registration when it is already disabled or enabling it when already enabled is acceptable.When portmapper registration reporting is enabled,
 lsof displays the portmapper registration (if any) for local TCP, UDP or UDPLITE ports in square brackets immediately following the port numbers or
 service names - e.g., :1234[name] or :name[100083]. The registration information may be a name or number, depending on what the registering program
 supplied to the portmapper when it registered the port.When portmapper registration reporting is enabled,
 lsof may run a little more slowly or even become blocked when access to the portmapper becomes congested or stopped. Reverse the reporting mode to
 determine if portmapper registration reporting is slowing or blocking lsof.For purposes of portmapper registration reporting
 lsof considers a TCP, UDP or UDPLITE port local if: it is found in the local part of its containing kernel structure; or if it is located in the
 foreign part of its containing kernel structure and the local and foreign Internet addresses are the same; or if it is located in the foreign part of its
 containing kernel structure and the foreign Internet address is INADDR_LOOPBACK (127.0.0.1). This rule may make lsof ignore some foreign ports on
 machines with multiple interfaces when the foreign Internet address is on a different interface from the local one.See the
 lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for further discussion of portmapper registration reporting issues.-n
 This option inhibits the conversion of network numbers to host names for network files. Inhibiting conversion may make lsof run faster. It is also
 useful when host name lookup is not working properly.-N
 This option selects the listing of NFS files.-o
 This option directs lsof to display file offset at all times. It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to OFFSET. Note: on some UNIX
 dialects lsof cant obtain accurate or consistent file offset information from its kernel data sources, sometimes just for particular kinds of files
 (e.g., socket files.) Consult the lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information.The
 <b>-o</b> and <b>-s</b> options are mutually exclusive; they cant both be specified. When neither is specified, lsof displays whatever value - size
 or offset - is appropriate and available for the type of the file.-o This option defines the number of decimal digits (o) to be printed after the 0t for a file offset before the form is switched to 0x.... An
 o value of zero (unlimited) directs lsof to use the 0t form for all offset output.This option does NOT direct
 lsof to display offset at all times; specify <b>-o</b> (without a trailing number) to do that. This option only specifies the number of digits after
 0t in either mixed size and offset or offset-only output. Thus, for example, to direct lsof to display offset at all times with a decimal digit
 count of 10, use:<br>   -o -o 10or    -oo10
 The default number of digits allowed after 0t is normally 8, but may have been changed by the lsof builder. Consult the description of the <b>-o</b>
 o option in the output of the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option to determine the default that is in effect.-O
 This option directs lsof to bypass the strategy it uses to avoid being blocked by some kernel operations - i.e., doing them in forked child
 processes. See the <b>BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS</b> and <b>AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS</b> sections for more information on kernel operations that may block lsof.While use of this option will reduce
 lsof startup overhead, it may also cause lsof to hang when the kernel doesnt respond to a function. Use this option cautiously.-p This option excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the comma-separated set
 s - e.g., 123 or 123,^456. (There should be no spaces in the set.)PID numbers that begin with ^ (negation) represent exclusions.
 participating in AND option selection. However, PID exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before other selection criteria are
 applied.-P
 This option inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files. Inhibiting the conversion may make lsof run a little faster. It
 is also useful when port name lookup is not working properly.+|-r This option puts lsof in repeat mode. There lsof lists open files as selected by other options, delays t seconds (default fifteen),
 then repeats the listing, delaying and listing repetitively until stopped by a condition defined by the prefix to the option.If the prefix is a -, repeat mode is endless.
 Lsof must be terminated with an interrupt or quit signal.If the prefix is +, repeat mode will end the first cycle no open files
 are listed - and of course when lsof is stopped with an interrupt or quit signal. When repeat mode ends because no files are listed, the process
 exit code will be zero if any open files were ever listed; one, if none were ever listed.Lsofmarks the end of each listing: if field output is in progress (the <b>-F</b>, option has been specified), the default marker is m; otherwise the default
 marker is ========. The marker is followed by a NL character.The optional m<fmt> argument specifies a format for the marker line.
 The &lt;fmt&gt; characters following m are interpreted as a format specification to the <b><a href=/man/3/strftime>strftime</a></b>(3) function, when both it and the
 <b><a href=/man/3/localtime>localtime</a></b>(3) function are available in the dialects C library. Consult the <b><a href=/man/3/strftime rel=nofollow>strftime</a></b>(3) documentation for what may appear in its format
 specification. Note that when field output is requested with the <b>-F</b> option, &lt;fmt&gt; cannot contain the NL format, %n. Note also that when
 &lt;fmt&gt; contains spaces or other characters that affect the shells interpretation of arguments, &lt;fmt&gt; must be quoted appropriately.Repeat mode reduces
 lsof startup overhead, so it is more efficient to use this mode than to call lsof repetitively from a shell script, for example.To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany
 <b>+|-r</b> with specification of other lsof selection options, so the amount of kernel memory access lsof does will be kept to a minimum.
 Options that filter at the process level - e.g., <b>-c</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-u</b> - are the most efficient selectors.Repeat mode is useful when coupled with field output (see the
 <b>-F</b>, option description) and a supervising awk or Perl script, or a C program.-R
 This option directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification number in the PPID column.-s <b>s</b> alone directs lsof to display file size at all times. It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE. If the file does
 not have a size, nothing is displayed.When followed by a protocol a colon (:) and a comma-separated protocol state name list, the option causes open TCP and UDP files to be excluded if their state <b>name</b>(s) are in the
 list (s) preceded by a ^; or included if their <b>name</b>(s) are not preceded by a ^.When an inclusion list is defined, only network files with state
 names in the list will be present in the lsof output. Thus, specifying one state name means that only network files with that lone state name will
 be listed.Case is unimportant in the protocol or state names, but there may
 be no spaces and the colon (:) separating the protocol name (p) and the state name list (s) is required.If only TCP and UDP files are to be listed, as controlled by
 the specified exclusions and inclusions, the <b>-i</b> option must be specified, too. If only a single protocols files are to be listed, add its name as
 an argument to the <b>-i</b> option.For example, to list only network files with TCP state LISTEN, use:
 <br>   -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
 Or, for example, to list network files with all UDP states except Idle, use:<br>   -iUDP -sUDP:Idle
 State names vary with UNIX dialects, so its not possible to provide a complete list. Some common TCP state names are: CLOSED, IDLE, BOUND, LISTEN,
 ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT, SYN_RCDV, ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIT, FIN_WAIT1, CLOSING, LAST_ACK, FIN_WAIT_2, and TIME_WAIT. Two common UDP state names are Unbound and
 Idle.See the
 lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information on how to use protocol state exclusion and inclusion, including examples.The
 <b>-o</b> (without a following decimal digit count) and <b>-s</b> option (without a following protocol and state name list) are mutually exclusive; they
 cant both be specified. When neither is specified, lsof displays whatever value - size or offset - is appropriate and available for the type of file.Since some types of files dont have true sizes - sockets, FIFOs,
 pipes, etc. - lsof displays for their sizes the content amounts in their associated kernel buffers, if possible.-S This option specifies an optional time-out seconds value for kernel functions - <b><a href=/man/2/lstat rel=nofollow>lstat</a></b>(2), <b><a href=/man/2/readlink rel=nofollow>readlink</a></b>(2), and <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2) - that might
 otherwise deadlock. The minimum for t is two; the default, fifteen; when no value is specified, the default is used.See the
 <b>BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS</b> section for more information.-T This option controls the reporting of some TCP/TPI information, also reported by <b>netstat</b>(1), following the network addresses. In normal output the
 information appears in parentheses, each item except TCP or TPI state name identified by a keyword, followed by =, separated from others by a single
 space:<br>   <TCP or TPI state name>    QR=<read queue length>    QS=<send queue length>    SO=<socket options and values>    SS=<socket
 states>    TF=<TCP flags and values>    WR=<window read length>    WW=<window write length>
 Not all values are reported for all UNIX dialects. Items values (when available) are reported after the item name and =.When the field output mode is in effect (See
 <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b>.) each item appears as a field with a T leading character.-T
 with no following key characters disables TCP/TPI information reporting.-T
 with following characters selects the reporting of specific TCP/TPI information:<br>   f    selects reporting of socket options,        states and values, and TCP flags and        values.    q    selects queue length
 reporting.    s    selects connection state reporting.    w    selects window size reporting.
 Not all selections are enabled for some UNIX dialects. State may be selected for all dialects and is reported by default. The <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> help
 output for the <b>-T</b> option will show what selections may be used with the UNIX dialect.When
 <b>-T</b> is used to select information - i.e., it is followed by one or more selection characters - the displaying of state is disabled by default, and it
 must be explicitly selected again in the characters following <b>-T</b>. (In effect, then, the default is equivalent to <b>-Ts</b>.) For example, if queue
 lengths and state are desired, use <b>-Tqs</b>.Socket options, socket states, some socket values, TCP flags and
 one TCP value may be reported (when available in the UNIX dialect) in the form of the names that commonly appear after SO_, so_, SS_, TCP_ and TF_ in the
 dialects header files - most often &lt;<a href=/include/sys/socket.h rel=nofollow>sys/socket.h</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href=/include/sys/socketvar.h rel=nofollow>sys/socketvar.h</a>&gt; and &lt;netinet/tcp_var.h&gt;. Consult those header files for the meaning of
 the flags, options, states and values.SO= precedes socket options and values; SS=, socket states;
 and TF=, TCP flags and values.If a flag or option has a value, the value will follow an = and
 the name -- e.g., SO=LINGER=5, SO=QLIM=5, TF=MSS=512. The following seven values may be reported:<br>   Name    Reported    Description (Common Symbol)    KEEPALIVE    keep alive time (SO_KEEPALIVE)    LINGER    linger time (SO_LINGER)    MSS
 maximum segment size (TCP_MAXSEG)    PQLEN    partial listen queue connections    QLEN        established listen queue connections    QLIM        established
 listen queue limit    RCVBUF    receive buffer length (SO_RCVBUF)    SNDBUF    send buffer length (SO_SNDBUF)
 Details on what socket options and values, socket states, and TCP flags and values may be displayed for particular UNIX dialects may be found in the answer
 to the Why doesnt lsof report socket options, socket states, and TCP flags and values for my dialect? and Why doesnt lsof report the partial listen
 queue connection count for my dialect? questions in the lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)-t
 This option specifies that lsof should produce terse output with process identifiers only and no header - e.g., so that the output may be piped to
 <b><a href=/man/1/kill>kill</a></b>(1). This option selects the <b>-w</b> option.-u This option selects the listing of files for the user whose login names or user ID numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g., abe, or
 548,root. (There should be no spaces in the set.)Multiple login names or user ID numbers are joined in a single ORed set
 before participating in AND option selection.If a login name or user ID is preceded by a ^, it becomes a negation -
 i.e., files of processes owned by the login name or user ID will never be listed. A negated login name or user ID selection is neither ANDed nor ORed with
 other selections; it is applied before all other selections and absolutely excludes the listing of the files of the process. For example, to direct lsof
 to exclude the listing of files belonging to root processes, specify -u^root or -u^0.-U
 This option selects the listing of UNIX domain socket files.-v
 This option selects the listing of lsof version information, including: revision number; when the lsof binary was constructed; who
 constructed the binary and where; the name of the compiler used to construct the lsof binary; the version number of the compiler when readily available;
 the compiler and loader flags used to construct the lsof binary; and system information, typically the output of unames <b>-a</b> option.-V
 This option directs lsof to indicate the items it was asked to list and failed to find - command names, file names, Internet addresses or files,
 login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, and UIDs.When other options are ANDed to search options, or compile-time
 options restrict the listing of some files, lsof may not report that it failed to find a search item when an ANDed option or compile-time option
 prevents the listing of the open file containing the located search item.For example, failure to locate open files at TCP@foobar and may not list any, if none have a file descriptor number of 999. A similar situation arises when
 HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY are defined at compile time and they prevent the listing of open files.+|-w
 Enables (<b>+</b>) or disables (<b>-</b>) the suppression of warning messages.The
 lsof builder may choose to have warning messages disabled or enabled by default. The default warning message state is indicated in the output of the
 <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option. Disabling warning messages when they are already disabled or enabling them when already enabled is acceptable.The
 <b>-t</b> option selects the <b>-w</b> option.-x  [fl]
 This option may accompany the <b>+d</b> and <b>+D</b> options to direct their processing to cross over symbolic links and|or file system mount points
 encountered when scanning the directory (<b>+d</b>) or directory tree (<b>+D</b>).If
 <b>-x</b> is specified by itself without a following parameter, cross-over processing of both symbolic links and file system mount points is enabled. Note
 that when <b>-x</b> is specified without a parameter, the next argument must begin with - or +.The optional f parameter enables file system mount point cross-over
 processing; l, symbolic link cross-over processing.The
 <b>-x</b> option may not be supplied without also supplying a <b>+d</b> or <b>+D</b> option.-X
 This is a dialect-specific option.    AIX:
 <br>
 This IBM AIX RISC/System 6000 option requests the reporting of executed text file and shared library references.WARNING:
 because this option uses the kernel readx() function, its use on a busy AIX system might cause an application process to hang so completely that it can
 neither be killed nor stopped. I have never seen this happen or had a report of its happening, but I think there is a remote possibility it could happen.By default use of readx() is disabled.
 On AIX 5L and above lsof may need setuid-root permission to perform the actions this option requests.The
 lsof builder may specify that the <b>-X</b> option be restricted to processes whose real UID is root. If that has been done, the <b>-X</b> option
 will not appear in the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> help output unless the real UID of the lsof process is root. The default lsof distribution allows
 any UID to specify <b>-X,</b> so by default it will appear in the help output.When AIX readx() use
 is disabled, lsof may not be able to report information for all text and loader file references, but it may also avoid exacerbating an AIX kernel
 directory search kernel error, known as the Stale Segment ID bug.The readx() function, used by
 lsof or any other program to access some sections of kernel virtual memory, can trigger the Stale Segment ID bug. It can cause the kernels
 dir_search() function to believe erroneously that part of an in-memory copy of a file system directory has been zeroed. Another application process, distinct
 from lsof, asking the kernel to search the directory - e.g., by using <b><a href=/man/2/open>open</a></b>(2) - can cause dir_search() to loop forever, thus hanging the
 application process.Consult the
 lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) and the 00README file of the lsof distribution for a more complete description
 of the Stale Segment ID bug, its APAR, and methods for defining readx() use when compiling lsof.    Linux:
 <br>
 This Linux option requests that lsof skip the reporting of information on all open TCP, UDP and UDPLITE IPv4 and IPv6 files.This Linux option is most useful when the system has an extremely
 large number of open TCP, UDP and UDPLITE files, the processing of whose information in the /proc/net/tcp* and /proc/net/udp* files would
 take lsof a long time, and whose reporting is not of interest.Use this option with care and only when you are sure that the
 information you want lsof to display isnt associated with open TCP, UDP or UDPLITE socket files.    Solaris 10 and above:
 <br>
 This Solaris 10 and above option requests the reporting of cached paths for files that have been deleted - i.e., removed with <b><a href=/man/1/rm>rm</a></b>(1) or <b><a href=/man/2/unlink>unlink</a></b>(2).The cached path is followed by the string  (deleted) to indicate
 that the path by which the file was opened has been deleted.Because intervening changes made to the path - i.e., renames with
 <b><a href=/man/1/mv>mv</a></b>(1) or <b><a href=/man/2/rename>rename</a></b>(2) - are not recorded in the cached path, what lsof reports is only the path by which the file was opened, not its
 possibly different final path.-z specifies how Solaris 10 and higher zone information is to be handled.Without a following argument - e.g., NO
 z - the option specifies that zone names are to be listed in the ZONE output column.The
 <b>-z</b> option may be followed by a zone name, <b>z</b>. That causes lsof to list only open files for processes in that zone. Multiple <b>-z</b>
 z option and argument pairs may be specified to form a list of named zones. Any open file of any process in any of the zones will be listed, subject to
 other conditions specified by other options and arguments.-Z[Z]specifies how SELinux security contexts are to be handled. This option and Z field output character support are inhibited when SELinux is disabled in the
 running Linux kernel. See <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> for more information on the Z field output character.Without a following argument - e.g., NO
 Z - the option specifies that security contexts are to be listed in the SECURITY-CONTEXT output column.The
 <b>-Z</b> option may be followed by a wildcard security context name, <b>Z</b>. That causes lsof to list only open files for processes in that
 security context. Multiple <b>-Z</b> Z option and argument pairs may be specified to form a list of security contexts. Any open file of any process in
 any of the security contexts will be listed, subject to other conditions specified by other options and arguments. Note that Z can be A:B:C or *:B:C or
 A:B:* or *:*:C to match against the A:B:C context.--
 The double minus sign option is a marker that signals the end of the keyed options. It may be used, for example, when the first file name begins with a
 minus sign. It may also be used when the absence of a value for the last keyed option must be signified by the presence of a minus sign in the following option
 and before the start of the file names.namesThese are path names of specific files to list. Symbolic links are resolved before use. The first name may be separated from the preceding options with the
 -- option.If a
 name is the mounted-on directory of a file system or the device of the file system, lsof will list all the files open on the file system. To
 be considered a file system, the name must match a mounted-on directory name in <b><a href=mount rel=nofollow>mount</a></b>(8) output, or match the name of a block device associated
 with a mounted-on directory name. The <b>+|-f</b> option may be used to force lsof to consider a name a file system identifier (<b>+f</b>) or a
 simple file (<b>-f</b>).If
 name is a path to a directory that is not the mounted-on directory name of a file system, it is treated just as a regular file is treated - i.e.,
 its listing is restricted to processes that have it open as a file or as a process-specific directory, such as the root or current working directory. To
 request that lsof look for open files inside a directory name, use the <b>+d</b> s and <b>+D</b> D options.If a
 name is the base name of a family of multiplexed files - e. g, AIXs /dev/pt[cs] - lsof will list all the associated multiplexed files
 on the device that are open - e.g., /dev/pt[cs]/1, /dev/pt[cs]/2, etc.If a
 name is a UNIX domain socket name, lsof will usually search for it by the characters of the name alone - exactly as it is specified and is
 recorded in the kernel socket structure. (See the next paragraph for an exception to that rule for Linux.) Specifying a relative path - e.g., ./file -
 in place of the files absolute path - e.g., /tmp/file - wont work because lsof must match the characters you specify with what it finds in the
 kernel UNIX domain socket structures.If a
 name is a Linux UNIX domain socket name, in one case lsof is able to search for it by its device and inode number, allowing name to be
 a relative path. The case requires that the absolute path -- i.e., one beginning with a slash (/) be used by the process that created the socket, and hence
 be stored in the /proc/net/unix file; and it requires that lsof be able to obtain the device and node numbers of both the absolute path in
 /proc/net/unix and name via successful <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2) system calls. When those conditions are met, lsof will be able to search for the
 UNIX domain socket when some path to it is is specified in name. Thus, for example, if the path is /dev/log, and an lsof search is
 initiated when the working directory is /dev, then name could be ./log.If a
 name is none of the above, lsof will list any open files whose device and inode match that of the specified path name.If you have also specified the
 <b>-b</b> option, the only names you may safely specify are file systems for which your mount table supplies alternate device numbers. See the
 <b>AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS</b> and <b>ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS</b> sections for more information.Multiple file names are joined in a single ORed set before
 participating in AND option selection.

 are displayed.SIZE, SIZE/OFF, or OFFSET
 is the size of the file or the file offset in bytes. A value is displayed in this column only if it is available. Lsof displays whatever value -
 size or offset - is appropriate for the type of the file and the version of lsof.On some UNIX dialects
 lsof cant obtain accurate or consistent file offset information from its kernel data sources, sometimes just for particular kinds of files (e.g.,
 socket files.) In other cases, files dont have true sizes - e.g., sockets, FIFOs, pipes - so lsof displays for their sizes the content amounts it finds
 in their kernel buffer descriptors (e.g., socket buffer size counts or TCP/IP window sizes.) Consult the lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its
 location.) for more information.The file size is displayed in decimal;
 the offset is normally displayed in decimal with a leading 0t if it contains 8 digits or less; in hexadecimal with a leading 0x if it is longer
 than 8 digits. (Consult the <b>-o</b> o option description for information on when 8 might default to some other value.)Thus the leading 0t and 0x identify an offset when the column
 may contain both a size and an offset (i.e., its title is SIZE/OFF).If the
 <b>-o</b> option is specified, lsof always displays the file offset (or nothing if no offset is available) and labels the column OFFSET. The offset
 always begins with 0t or 0x as described above.The
 lsof user can control the switch from 0t to 0x with the <b>-o</b> o option. Consult its description for more information.If the
 <b>-s</b> option is specified, lsof always displays the file size (or nothing if no size is available) and labels the column SIZE. The <b>-o</b> and

 When the -F option is specified, <br><br>Each unit of information is output in a field that is identified with a leading character and terminated by a NL (012) (or a NUL (000) if the 0 (zero) field
 identifier character is specified.) The data of the field follows immediately after the field identification character and extends to the field terminator.<br><br>It is possible to think of field output as process and file sets. A process set begins with a field whose identifier is p (for process IDentifier (PID)).
 It extends to the beginning of the next PID field or the beginning of the first file set of the process, whichever comes first. Included in the process set are
 fields that identify the command, the process group IDentification (PGID) number, and the user ID (UID) number or login name.<br><br>A file set begins with a field whose identifier is f (for file descriptor). It is followed by lines that describe the files access mode, lock state,

 specification of the field character - e.g., <b>-FR</b> - also selects the listing of the item.<br><br>It is entirely possible to select a set of fields that cannot easily be parsed - e.g., if the field descriptor field is not selected, it may be difficult to
 identify file sets. To help you avoid this difficulty, lsof supports the <b>-F</b> option; it selects the output of all fields with NL terminators (the
 <b>-F0</b> option pair selects the output of all fields with NUL terminators). For compatibility reasons neither <b>-F</b> nor <b>-F0</b> select the raw device
 field.<br><br>These are the fields that lsof will produce. The single character listed first is the field identifier.   -F? option pair. (Escape the ? character as your

 characters and file major/minor device numbers; file inode number and protocol name; file name and stream identification; file size and offset. One or the
 other member of these mutually exclusive sets will appear in field output, but not both.<br><br>Normally lsof ends each field with a NL (012) character. The 0 (zero) field identifier character may be specified to change the field terminator
 character to a NUL (000). A NUL terminator may be easier to process with xargs (1), for example, or with programs whose quoting mechanisms may not
 easily cope with the range of characters in the field output. When the NUL field terminator is in use, lsof ends each process and file set with a NL
 (012).<br><br>Three aids to producing programs that can process lsof field output are included in the lsof distribution. The first is a C header file,

 scripts subdirectory of the lsof distribution.<br><br>The third aid is the C library used for the lsof test suite. The test suite is written in C and uses field output to validate the correct operation

 <br><br>mpage reads plain text files or PostScript documents and prints them on a PostScript printer with the text reduced in size so that several pages
 appear on one sheet of paper. This is useful for viewing large printouts on a small amount of paper. It uses ISO 8859.1 to print 8-bit characters.<br><br>The following options are recognized (note that arguments to options may be separated from the option by spaces, except for <b>-B</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-M</b>,

Papersize can be A3 for European A3, A4 for European A4, Letter for US Letter or
 Legal for Legal sized paper. For default see mpage -x. To see the list of currently available types, just give the mpage -bl or mpage -b? command
 (Note: mpage exits after finding such option use.)-B[lrtb]*]
 Setup a box around a particular part of your page. Specify text box margins and line thickness. The default is 0 columns (lines) for both left and right
 (top and bottom) margins and 0 line thickness. Specifying <b>-B</b> solely toggles printing of the box. l, r, t or b set the left,
 right, top or bottom margin respectively to &lt;num&gt; columns (lines). Not specifying any of the sides, will set the line thickness when
 &lt;num&gt; is given. For example <b>-B</b>1 sets the line thickness to 1. Sides with negative margins will not print.-c

 <br><br>Toggle concatenation off pages from different files on single sheets (default off).-C[Specify the character encoding file. The file should be in the mpage library directory (/usr/share/mpage). Mpage has an internal default
 encoding based on Latin-1 or IBM codepage 850. Depending on compile time option this encoding definition is on or not. Not specifying an encodingfile will
 toggle the usage of the internal encoding.-da<br><br>Force input to be taken as ascii (a) or postscript (p) text. This way you can print your postscript code as text, or print postscript code
 that mpage does not recognise. When using <b>-d</b>p, make sure that the the postscript code contains %Page page separators or else things will
 probably look odd.-DdateformatSet the date format as in <b><a href=/man/3/strftime>strftime</a></b>(3) to be used in date/time representations (e.g. in headers). (Note: to be useful you probably need the <b>-H</b>
 option.)-e

 <br><br>Print 2 normal pages per sheet in duplex mode. Every first and fourth page or on one side and every second and third on the other side. This is more or less
 a combination of the -O and -E option but then in one pass.<br><br><b>-E</b><br><br>Print 2 normal pages per sheet. However, this option will print every second and third page of every set of four pages. This option will ignore <b>-a</b>
 and <b>-l</b>. See also the -O option. Using these options double sided prints can be created without a duplex printer.<br><br><b>-f</b><br><br>Toggles folding lines longer than page width (default off) .-FfontnameSpecify font. (default Courier). Check your printer for supported fonts. Note: this has almost nothing to do with the fonts used for your
 X-windows/KDE/Gnome environment.-hheaderThis is used only when the <b>-p</b> or <b>-H</b> switch is used and is passed as the <b>-h</b> header option to <b>pr</b>(<b>1</b>) or as the
 header for <b>-H</b>.-H

 <br><br>Create header line for each logical page separated from page text by a horizontal line. Unless <b>-h</b> is given, the header consist of last file
 modification time, filename and page number, all in bold and slightly larger font. This option only applies to non-postscript files.-IindentIndent text by indent characters.-jfirstPrint just the selected sheets, specified by a number, starting at 1. Here last defaults to the end of data, interval to 1. Several <b>-j</b>
 options can be given (upto MAXJARGS, default 100) to create a complex selection of pages. Thus <b>-j</b>1-10 selects the first 10 sheets, while
 <b>-j</b> 1%2 prints just the odd-numbered sheets and <b>-j</b> 2%2 prints just the even ones.
 <p>You can do double-sided printing, in two passes, as follows. If you use 3-hole punched paper, put it in the printer such that the holes will appear at the
 top of the page -- on the right as you pull out the printer tray, in our Laser writer II NTX. Print the odd-numbered sheets with
 </p>mpage ... -j 1%2 ...Note the number of pages it reports. (Only half this many will really be printed). When printing finishes, if mpage reported an odd number of pages,
 remove the last one from the stack, since there will be no even-numbered sheet to match it. Then arrange the stack of paper for printing on the other side. (If
 its punched, the holes will now be on the left.) On our II NTX, the paper comes out blank-side up; replace it in the tray still blank-side up but rotated 180
 degrees. For other printers, you figure it out. Now print the even-numbered sheets in reverse order withmpage ... -r -j 2%2 ...hoping no one else reaches the printer before you do.-JstartpagenoSet the start value of the sheet page count to startpageno instead of 1.-k

 <br><br>When mpage finds a %%TRailer or %%PSTrailer in the postscript input file it normally assumes this is the end of the postscript file and stops reading the
 input file. But when the PS file includes EPS files, %%Trailers might be anywhere. Using this option ignores the %%TRailer and %%PSTRailer lines.<br><br><b>-l</b><br><br>Toggle printing landscape or portrait mode. Landscape pages are 55 lines long by 132 characters wide by default. Portrait pages are 66 lines long by 80
 characters wide by default. (default portrait.)-LlinesAdjust the page reduction parameters so that lines lines will fit in the space of one page. This overrides the default values normally supplied. (See
 <b>-l</b>.) If used in conjunction with <b>-p</b> then this value is passed to the <b><a href=pr>pr</a></b>(1) as well. As a side effect this changes the font size as well
 (as will the <b>-W</b> option.) So while there is an option to change font family, there is no explicit option to change font size!-m[lrtb]*]
 Specify sheet margin. The default margin is 20 points. Only specifying <b>-m</b> sets left margin to 40 points. l, r, t or b set
 left, right, top or bottom margin respectively to &lt;num&gt; points. Not specifying any of the sides will set all sides when &lt;num&gt; is
 given. &lt;num&gt; defaults to 40 points. For example <b>-m</b>10 sets all margins to 10 points. <b>-m</b>l50tb sets left margin to
 default 40 and top and bottom margin to 50 points. <b>-m</b>50l25bt30r set bottom and top margin to 25, left margin to 50 and right margin to 30 points.
 Margins can have negative numbers.-M[lrtb]*]
 Specify logical page margins. For syntax, see <b>-m</b> option. Defaults are 4 for <b>-M</b> solely, and 8 for &lt;num&gt;. Margins can be negative.
 This way large white borders in your (postscript) documents can be reduced.-o

 <br><br>Toggle printing of outlines around each reduced page (default on).<br><br><b>-O</b><br><br>Print 2 normal pages per sheet. However, this option will print every first and fourth page of every set of four pages. This option will ignore <b>-a</b>
 and <b>-l</b>. See also the -E option. Using these options double sided prints can be created without a duplex printer.-p[Pipe input through prprog command (including specified options) before printing (assumes the input is a text file). When no command is specified, it
 defaults to <b><a href=pr rel=nofollow>pr</a></b>(1).-P[Specify the printer to which the PostScript output will be sent (e.g.lpr -Pprinter). Using <b>-P</b> with no printer specified will send the
 PostScript to the default printer queue (e.g. lpr). Using -P- will return output to stdout, useful in combination with MPAGE environment variable. Without
 <b>-P</b> output will be send to standard output.-r

 <br><br>Reverse printing. The last sheet is printed first. The way of arranging reduced pages on the sheets doesnt change.<br><br><b>-R</b><br><br>Switch to left to right mode, starting first page on left bottom corner. This might be useful for landscape postscript files. (Note: using <b>-l</b> after
 <b>-R</b> undoes <b>-R</b>, and switches to normal landscape mode.-stabstopSet tabstop width (default 8 characters). Should by &gt;= 2.-S

 <br><br>Accept non-square page reduction. By default, pages are shrunk equally in X and Y, even if this wastes some space on the sheet. With <b>-S</b>, reduced
 pages are larger but slightly distorted. (only used when printing postscript files.)<br><br><b>-t</b><br><br>Toggle printing on both sides of the paper. This will toggle duplex mode of the printer. Use this option only if your printer is capable of printing in
 duplex mode. (default off).<br><br><b>-T</b><br><br>Toggle tumble of every second pages when printing in duplex mode. Use this option only if your printer is capable of printing in duplex mode and together
 with <b>-t</b>.<br><br><b>-u</b><br><br>Toggle checking for UTF-8 input (not relevant for postscript input).<br><br><b>-U</b><br><br>This option is deprecated, see <b>-b</b>. Prepare output for US Letter sized paper. For default see mpage -x.<br><br><b>-v</b><br><br>Toggle printing a count of the number of sheets produced for printing (default off.)<br><br><b>-V</b><br><br>Print version information and exit.-WwidthAdjust the page reduction parameters so that a line with width characters long will fit in the space of one page. This overrides the default values
 normally supplied. (See <b>-l</b>.) If used in conjunction with <b>-p</b> then this value is passed to the s <b><a href=pr rel=nofollow>pr</a></b>(1) program as well. See also the
 <b>-L</b> option on font sizes.-x

 <br><br>Force usage display, which also shows current defaults.-X [header]
 Print header on the left and the page number on the right of each physical page (sheet). If no header is given, the default is the current filename (note
 influence of <b>-c</b>), the filename of the first file on the page is used.-zprintcommandSpecify command to use to send output to. Default is <b>lpr</b> (1) for BSD style spooler, <b>lp</b> (1) for SYSV style spooler. You can specify command
 line options, but note <b>-Z</b>. For example <b>-zlp</b> for system V Unix.-Zprintprog_queuename_argSpecify what option to use for the <b>-z</b> printcommand to specify a printqueue. For example <b>-zlp -Z-d</b> for system V Unix. Default is

 completion (see <b>Completion and listing</b>), spelling correction (see <b>Spelling correction</b>), a history mechanism (see <b>History substitution</b>),
 job control (see <b>Jobs</b>) and a C-like syntax. The <b>NEW FEATURES</b> section describes major enhancements of tcsh over <b>csh</b>(1). Throughout
 this manual, features of tcsh not found in most <b>csh</b>(1) implementations (specifically, the 4.4BSD csh) are labeled with (+), and features

 (+)After processing of flag arguments, if arguments remain but none of the -c, -i, -s, or -t options were given, the first argument
 is taken as the name of a file of commands, or script, to be executed. The shell opens this file and saves its name for possible resubstitution by $0.
 Because many systems use either the standard version 6 or version 7 shells whose shell scripts are not compatible with this shell, the shell uses such a
 standard shell to execute a script whose first character is not a #, i.e., that does not start with a comment.

 <br><br>Non-login shells read only /etc/csh.cshrc and ~/.tcshrc or ~/.cshrc on startup.<br><br>For examples of startup files, please consult <a href=http://tcshrc.sourceforge.net/>http://tcshrc.sourceforge.net</a>.<br><br>Commands like <b><a href=stty rel=nofollow>stty</a></b>(1) and <b><a href=tset rel=nofollow>tset</a></b>(1), which need be run only once per login, usually go in ones ~/.login file. Users who need to use the
 same set of files with both <b>csh</b>(1) and tcsh can have only a ~/.cshrc which checks for the existence of the <b>tcsh</b> shell variable
 (q.v.) before using tcsh-specific commands, or can have both a ~/.cshrc and a ~/.tcshrc which sources (see the builtin command)
 ~/.cshrc. The rest of this manual uses ~/.tcshrc to mean ~/.tcshrc or, if ~/.tcshrc is not found, ~/.cshrc.<br><br>In the normal case, the shell begins reading commands from the terminal, prompting with &gt; . (Processing of arguments and the use of the shell to
 process files containing command scripts are described later.) The shell repeatedly reads a line of command input, breaks it into words, places it on the
 command history list, parses it and executes each command in the line.<br><br>One can log out by typing ^D on an empty line, logout or login or via the shells autologout mechanism (see the <b>autologout</b> shell variable).
 When a login shell terminates it sets the <b>logout</b> shell variable to normal or automatic as appropriate, then executes commands from the files
 /etc/csh.logout and ~/.logout. The shell may drop DTR on logout if so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.<br><br>The names of the system login and logout files vary from system to system for compatibility with different <b>csh</b>(1) variants; see <b>FILES</b>.

 <br><br><b>Editing</b>
 The command-line editor. The Completion and listing and Spelling correction sections describe two sets of
 functionality that are implemented as editor commands but which deserve their own treatment. Finally, Editor commands lists and describes the editor
 commands specific to the shell and their default bindings.
 <br><br><b>The command-line editor (+)</b>
 <a href=vi rel=nofollow>vi</a>(1). The editor is active only when the edit shell
 variable is set, which it is by default in interactive shells. The version shell variable), but <br><br>The shell always binds the arrow keys (as defined in the <b>TERMCAP</b> environment variable) todown

 <p>down-history

 </p><p>up

 </p><p>up-history

 </p><p>left

 </p><p>backward-char

 </p><p>right

 </p><p>forward-char
 </p>unless doing so would alter another single-character binding. One can set the arrow key escape sequences to the empty string with <br><br>Other key bindings are, for the most part, what Emacs and <b><a href=vi rel=nofollow>vi</a></b>(1) users would expect and can easily be displayed by bindkey, so there is no need
 to list them here. Likewise, bindkey can list the editor commands with a short description of each.<br><br>Note that editor commands do not have the same notion of a word as does the shell. The editor delimits words with any non-alphanumeric characters not in
 the shell variable <b>wordchars</b>, while the shell recognizes only whitespace and some of the characters with special meanings to it, listed under <b>Lexical
 structure</b>.

 <br><br><b>Completion and listing (+)</b>
 addsuffix shell variable can be unset to prevent this.) If no match is found
 (perhaps /usr/lost+found doesnt exist), the terminal bell rings. If the word is already complete (perhaps there is a /usr/lost on your system, or perhaps
 you were thinking too far ahead and typed the whole thing) a / or space is added to the end if it isnt already there.
 <br><br>Completion works anywhere in the line, not at just the end; completed text pushes the rest of the line to the right. Completion in the middle of a word
 often results in leftover characters to the right of the cursor that need to be deleted.<br><br>Commands and variables can be completed in much the same way. For example, typing em[tab] would complete em to emacs if emacs were the only
 command on your system beginning with em. Completion can find a command in any directory in <b>path</b> or if given a full pathname. Typing echo $ar[tab]
 would complete $ar to $argv if no other variable began with ar.<br><br>The shell parses the input buffer to determine whether the word you want to complete should be completed as a filename, command or variable. The first word
 in the buffer and the first word following ;, |, |&amp;, &amp;&amp; or || is considered to be a command. A word beginning with $ is considered to
 be a variable. Anything else is a filename. An empty line is completed as a filename.<br><br>You can list the possible completions of a word at any time by typing ^D to run the delete-char-or-list-or-eof editor command. The shell lists the
 possible completions using the ls-F builtin (q.v.) and reprints the prompt and unfinished command line, for example:&gt; ls /usr/l[^D]lbin/ lib/ local/ lost+found/<br>
 &gt; ls /usr/lIf the autolist shell variable is set, the shell lists the remaining choices (if any) whenever completion fails:
 &gt; set autolist&gt; nm /usr/lib/libt[tab]<br>
 libtermcap.a@ libtermlib.a@<br>
 &gt; nm /usr/lib/libtermIf autolist is set to ambiguous, choices are listed only when completion fails and adds no new characters to the word being completed.

 <br><br>A filename to be completed can contain variables, your own or others home directories abbreviated with ~ (see <b>Filename substitution</b>) and directory
 stack entries abbreviated with = (see <b>Directory stack substitution</b>). For example,&gt; ls ~k[^D]kahn kas kellogg<br>
 &gt; ls ~ke[tab]<br>
 &gt; ls ~kellogg/or
 &gt; set local = /usr/local&gt; ls $lo[tab]<br>
 &gt; ls $local/[^D]<br>
 bin/ etc/ lib/ man/ src/<br>
 &gt; ls $local/Note that variables can also be expanded explicitly with the <br><br>delete-char-or-list-or-eof lists at only the end of the line; in the middle of a line it deletes the character under the cursor and on an empty line
 it logs one out or, if <b>ignoreeof</b> is set, does nothing. M-^D, bound to the editor command list-choices, lists completion possibilities anywhere
 on a line, and list-choices (or any one of the related editor commands that do or dont delete, list and/or log out, listed under
 delete-char-or-list-or-eof) can be bound to ^D with the bindkey builtin command if so desired.<br><br>The complete-word-fwd and complete-word-back editor commands (not bound to any keys by default) can be used to cycle up and down through the
 list of possible completions, replacing the current word with the next or previous word in the list.<br><br>The shell variable <b>fignore</b> can be set to a list of suffixes to be ignored by completion. Consider the following:&gt; lsMakefile condiments.h~ main.o side.c<br>
 README main.c meal side.o<br>
 condiments.h main.c~<br>
 &gt; set fignore = (.o \~)<br>
 &gt; emacs ma[^D]<br>
 main.c main.c~ main.o<br>
 &gt; emacs ma[tab]<br>
 &gt; emacs main.cmain.c~ and main.o are ignored by completion (but not listing), because they end in suffixes in fignore. Note that a \ was needed in front of
 ~ to prevent it from being expanded to home as described under Filename substitution. fignore is ignored if only one completion is
 possible.
 <br><br>If the <b>complete</b> shell variable is set to enhance, completion 1) ignores case and 2) considers periods, hyphens and underscores (., - and _)
 to be word separators and hyphens and underscores to be equivalent. If you had the following filescomp.lang.c comp.lang.perl comp.std.c++comp.lang.c++ comp.std.cand typed mail -f c.l.c[tab], it would be completed to mail -f comp.lang.c, and ^D would list comp.lang.c and comp.lang.c++. mail -f c..c++[^D]
 would list comp.lang.c++ and comp.std.c++. Typing rm a--file[^D] in the following directory
 A_silly_file a-hyphenated-file another_silly_filewould list all three files, because case is ignored and hyphens and underscores are equivalent. Periods, however, are not equivalent to hyphens or
 underscores.
 <br><br>Completion and listing are affected by several other shell variables: <b>recexact</b> can be set to complete on the shortest possible unique match, even if
 more typing might result in a longer match:&gt; lsfodder foo food foonly<br>
 &gt; set recexact<br>
 &gt; rm fo[tab]just beeps, because fo could expand to fod or foo, but if we type another o,
 &gt; rm foo[tab]&gt; rm foothe completion completes on foo, even though food and foonly also match. autoexpand can be set to run the autocorrect can be set to spelling-correct the word to be completed (see Spelling correction) before each
 completion attempt and correct can be set to complete commands automatically after one hits return. matchbeep can be set to make completion
 beep or not beep in a variety of situations, and nobeep can be set to never beep at all. nostat can be set to a list of directories and/or
 patterns that match directories to prevent the completion mechanism from <a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a>(2)ing those directories. listmax and listmaxrows can be set
 to limit the number of items and rows (respectively) that are listed without asking first. recognize_only_executables can be set to make the shell list
 only executables when listing commands, but it is quite slow.
 <br><br>Finally, the complete builtin command can be used to tell the shell how to complete words other than filenames, commands and variables. Completion
 and listing do not work on glob-patterns (see <b>Filename substitution</b>), but the list-glob and expand-glob editor commands perform equivalent
 functions for glob-patterns.

 <br><br><b>Spelling correction (+)</b>
 <br><br>Individual words can be spelling-corrected with the spell-word editor command (usually bound to M-s and M-S) and the entire input buffer with
 spell-line (usually bound to M-$). The <b>correct</b> shell variable can be set to cmd to correct the command name or all to correct the entire line
 each time return is typed, and <b>autocorrect</b> can be set to correct the word to be completed before each completion attempt.<br><br>When spelling correction is invoked in any of these ways and the shell thinks that any part of the command line is misspelled, it prompts with the corrected
 line:&gt; set correct = cmd&gt; lz /usr/bin<br>
 CORRECT&gt;ls /usr/bin (y|n|e|a)?One can answer y or space to execute the corrected line, e to leave the uncorrected command in the input buffer, a to abort the command as if ^C had
 been hit, and anything else to execute the original line unchanged.
 <br><br>Spelling correction recognizes user-defined completions (see the complete builtin command). If an input word in a position for which a completion is
 defined resembles a word in the completion list, spelling correction registers a misspelling and suggests the latter word as a correction. However, if the
 input word does not match any of the possible completions for that position, spelling correction does not register a misspelling.<br><br>Like completion, spelling correction works anywhere in the line, pushing the rest of the line to the right and possibly leaving extra characters to the
 right of the cursor.<br><br>Beware: spelling correction is not guaranteed to work the way one intends, and is provided mostly as an experimental feature. Suggestions and improvements
 are welcome.

 <br><br><b>Editor commands (+)</b>
 <a href=emacs rel=nofollow>emacs</a>(1) and <a href=vi rel=nofollow>vi</a>(1) for descriptions of each editors key bindings.
 <br><br>The character or characters to which each command is bound by default is given in parentheses. ^character means a control character and
 M-character a meta character, typed as escape-character on terminals without a meta key. Case counts, but commands that are bound to letters by
 default are bound to both lower- and uppercase letters for convenience.complete-word (tab)
 Completes a word as described under <b>Completion and listing</b>.complete-word-back (not bound)
 Like complete-word-fwd, but steps up from the end of the list.complete-word-fwd (not bound)
 Replaces the current word with the first word in the list of possible completions. May be repeated to step down through the list. At the end of the list,
 beeps and reverts to the incomplete word.complete-word-raw (^X-tab)
 Like complete-word, but ignores user-defined completions.copy-prev-word (M-^_)
 Copies the previous word in the current line into the input buffer. See also insert-last-word.dabbrev-expand (M-/)
 Expands the current word to the most recent preceding one for which the current is a leading substring, wrapping around the history list (once) if
 necessary. Repeating dabbrev-expand without any intervening typing changes to the next previous word etc., skipping identical matches much like
 history-search-backward does.delete-char (not bound)
 Deletes the character under the cursor. See also delete-char-or-list-or-eof.delete-char-or-eof (not bound)
 Does delete-char if there is a character under the cursor or end-of-file on an empty line. See also delete-char-or-list-or-eof.delete-char-or-list (not bound)
 Does delete-char if there is a character under the cursor or list-choices at the end of the line. See also
 delete-char-or-list-or-eof.delete-char-or-list-or-eof (^D)
 Does delete-char if there is a character under the cursor, list-choices at the end of the line or end-of-file on an empty line. See
 also those three commands, each of which does only a single action, and delete-char-or-eof, delete-char-or-list and list-or-eof, each of
 which does a different two out of the three.down-history (down-arrow, ^N)
 Like up-history, but steps down, stopping at the original input line.end-of-file (not bound)
 Signals an end of file, causing the shell to exit unless the <b>ignoreeof</b> shell variable (q.v.) is set to prevent this. See also
 delete-char-or-list-or-eof.expand-history (M-space)
 Expands history substitutions in the current word. See <b>History substitution</b>. See also magic-space, toggle-literal-history and the
 <b>autoexpand</b> shell variable.expand-glob (^X-*)
 Expands the glob-pattern to the left of the cursor. See <b>Filename substitution</b>.expand-line (not bound)
 Like expand-history, but expands history substitutions in each word in the input buffer,expand-variables (^X-$)
 Expands the variable to the left of the cursor. See <b>Variable substitution</b>.history-search-backward (M-p, M-P)
 Searches backwards through the history list for a command beginning with the current contents of the input buffer up to the cursor and copies it into the
 input buffer. The search string may be a glob-pattern (see <b>Filename substitution</b>) containing *, ?, [] or {}. up-history and
 down-history will proceed from the appropriate point in the history list. Emacs mode only. See also history-search-forward and
 i-search-back.history-search-forward (M-n, M-N)
 Like history-search-backward, but searches forward.i-search-back (not bound)
 Searches backward like history-search-backward, copies the first match into the input buffer with the cursor positioned at the end of the pattern,
 and prompts with bck:  and the first match. Additional characters may be typed to extend the search, i-search-back may be typed to continue searching
 with the same pattern, wrapping around the history list if necessary, (i-search-back must be bound to a single character for this to work) or one of the
 following special characters may be typed:^W

 <p>Appends the rest of the word under the cursor to the search pattern.
 </p>delete (or any character bound to backward-delete-char)

 <br><br>Undoes the effect of the last character typed and deletes a character from the search pattern if appropriate.<br><br>^G<br><br>If the previous search was successful, aborts the entire search. If not, goes back to the last successful search.<br><br>escape<br><br>Ends the search, leaving the current line in the input buffer.
 Any other character not bound to self-insert-command terminates the search, leaving the current line in the input buffer, and is then interpreted as
 normal input. In particular, a carriage return causes the current line to be executed. Emacs mode only. See also i-search-fwd and
 history-search-backward.i-search-fwd (not bound)
 Like i-search-back, but searches forward.insert-last-word (M-_)
 Inserts the last word of the previous input line (!$) into the input buffer. See also copy-prev-word.list-choices (M-^D)
 Lists completion possibilities as described under <b>Completion and listing</b>. See also delete-char-or-list-or-eof and
 list-choices-raw.list-choices-raw (^X-^D)
 Like list-choices, but ignores user-defined completions.list-glob (^X-g, ^X-G)
 Lists (via the ls-F builtin) matches to the glob-pattern (see <b>Filename substitution</b>) to the left of the cursor.list-or-eof (not bound)
 Does list-choices or end-of-file on an empty line. See also delete-char-or-list-or-eof.magic-space (not bound)
 Expands history substitutions in the current line, like expand-history, and inserts a space. magic-space is designed to be bound to the space
 bar, but is not bound by default.normalize-command (^X-?)
 Searches for the current word in PATH and, if it is found, replaces it with the full path to the executable. Special characters are quoted. Aliases are
 expanded and quoted but commands within aliases are not. This command is useful with commands that take commands as arguments, e.g., dbx and sh -x.normalize-path (^X-n, ^X-N)
 Expands the current word as described under the expand setting of the <b>symlinks</b> shell variable.overwrite-mode (unbound)
 Toggles between input and overwrite modes.run-fg-editor (M-^Z)
 Saves the current input line and looks for a stopped job with a name equal to the last component of the file name part of the <b>EDITOR</b> or <b>VISUAL</b>
 environment variables, or, if neither is set, ed or vi. If such a job is found, it is restarted as if fg %job had been typed. This is used to
 toggle back and forth between an editor and the shell easily. Some people bind this command to ^Z so they can do this even more easily.run-help (M-h, M-H)
 Searches for documentation on the current command, using the same notion of current command as the completion routines, and prints it. There is no way to
 use a pager; run-help is designed for short help files. If the special alias <b>helpcommand</b> is defined, it is run with the command name as a sole
 argument. Else, documentation should be in a file named command.help, command.1, command.6, command.8 or command, which
 should be in one of the directories listed in the <b>HPATH</b> environment variable. If there is more than one help file only the first is printed.self-insert-command (text characters)
 In insert mode (the default), inserts the typed character into the input line after the character under the cursor. In overwrite mode, replaces the
 character under the cursor with the typed character. The input mode is normally preserved between lines, but the <b>inputmode</b> shell variable can be set to
 insert or overwrite to put the editor in that mode at the beginning of each line. See also overwrite-mode.sequence-lead-in (arrow prefix, meta prefix, ^X)
 Indicates that the following characters are part of a multi-key sequence. Binding a command to a multi-key sequence really creates two bindings: the first
 character to sequence-lead-in and the whole sequence to the command. All sequences beginning with a character bound to sequence-lead-in are
 effectively bound to undefined-key unless bound to another command.spell-line (M-$)
 Attempts to correct the spelling of each word in the input buffer, like spell-word, but ignores words whose first character is one of -, !, ^
 or %, or which contain \, * or ?, to avoid problems with switches, substitutions and the like. See <b>Spelling correction</b>.spell-word (M-s, M-S)
 Attempts to correct the spelling of the current word as described under <b>Spelling correction</b>. Checks each component of a word which appears to be a
 pathname.toggle-literal-history (M-r, M-R)
 Expands or unexpands history substitutions in the input buffer. See also expand-history and the <b>autoexpand</b> shell variable.undefined-key (any unbound key)
 Beeps.up-history (up-arrow, ^P)
 Copies the previous entry in the history list into the input buffer. If <b>histlit</b> is set, uses the literal form of the entry. May be repeated to step
 up through the history list, stopping at the top.vi-search-back (?)
 Prompts with ? for a search string (which may be a glob-pattern, as with history-search-backward), searches for it and copies it into the input
 buffer. The bell rings if no match is found. Hitting return ends the search and leaves the last match in the input buffer. Hitting escape ends the search and
 executes the match. vi mode only.vi-search-fwd (/)
 Like vi-search-back, but searches forward.which-command (M-?)
 Does a which (see the description of the builtin command) on the first word of the input buffer.yank-pop (M-y)
 When executed immediately after a yank or another yank-pop, replaces the yanked string with the next previous string from the killring. This
 also has the effect of rotating the killring, such that this string will be considered the most recently killed by a later yank command. Repeating
 yank-pop will cycle through the killring any number of times.

 <br><br><b>Lexical structure</b>
 <br><br>When the shells input is not a terminal, the character # is taken to begin a comment. Each # and the rest of the input line on which it appears is
 discarded before further parsing.<br><br>A special character (including a blank or tab) may be prevented from having its special meaning, and possibly made part of another word, by preceding it
 with a backslash (\) or enclosing it in single (), double () or backward () quotes. When not otherwise quoted a newline preceded by a \ is
 equivalent to a blank, but inside quotes this sequence results in a newline.<br><br>Furthermore, all <b>Substitutions</b> (see below) except <b>History substitution</b> can be prevented by enclosing the strings (or parts of strings) in
 which they appear with single quotes or by quoting the crucial <b>character</b>(s) (e.g., $ or  for <b>Variable substitution</b> or <b>Command substitution</b>
 respectively) with \. (<b>Alias substitution</b> is no exception: quoting in any way any character of a word for which an alias has been defined
 prevents substitution of the alias. The usual way of quoting an alias is to precede it with a backslash.) <b>History substitution</b> is prevented by
 backslashes but not by single quotes. Strings quoted with double or backward quotes undergo <b>Variable substitution</b> and <b>Command substitution</b>, but
 other substitutions are prevented.<br><br>Text inside single or double quotes becomes a single word (or part of one). Metacharacters in these strings, including blanks and tabs, do not form separate
 words. Only in one special case (see <b>Command substitution</b> below) can a double-quoted string yield parts of more than one word; single-quoted strings
 never do. Backward quotes are special: they signal <b>Command substitution</b> (q.v.), which may result in more than one word.<br><br>Quoting complex strings, particularly strings which themselves contain quoting characters, can be confusing. Remember that quotes need not be used as they
 are in human writing! It may be easier to quote not an entire string, but only those parts of the string which need quoting, using different types of quoting
 to do so if appropriate.<br><br>The <b>backslash_quote</b> shell variable (q.v.) can be set to make backslashes always quote \, , and . (+) This may make complex quoting tasks
 easier, but it can cause syntax errors in <b>csh</b>(1) scripts.

 <br><br><b>Substitutions</b>
 Lexical
 structure.
 <br><br><b>History substitution</b>
 history shell
 variable can be set to a number to save that many commands. The histdup shell variable can be set to not save duplicate events or consecutive duplicate
 events.
 <br><br>Saved commands are numbered sequentially from 1 and stamped with the time. It is not usually necessary to use event numbers, but the current event number
 can be made part of the prompt by placing an ! in the <b>prompt</b> shell variable.<br><br>The shell actually saves history in expanded and literal (unexpanded) forms. If the <b>histlit</b> shell variable is set, commands that display and store
 history use the literal form.<br><br>The history builtin command can print, store in a file, restore and clear the history list at any time, and the <b>savehist</b> and <b>histfile</b>
 shell variables can be can be set to store the history list automatically on logout and restore it on login.<br><br>History substitutions introduce words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, repeat arguments of a previous command
 in the current command, or fix spelling mistakes in the previous command with little typing and a high degree of confidence.<br><br>History substitutions begin with the character !. They may begin anywhere in the input stream, but they do not nest. The ! may be preceded by a \ to
 prevent its special meaning; for convenience, a ! is passed unchanged when it is followed by a blank, tab, newline, = or (. History substitutions also
 occur when an input line begins with ^. This special abbreviation will be described later. The characters used to signal history substitution (! and ^)
 can be changed by setting the <b>histchars</b> shell variable. Any input line which contains a history substitution is printed before it is executed.<br><br>A history substitution may have an event specification, which indicates the event from which words are to be taken, a word designator, which selects
 particular words from the chosen event, and/or a modifier, which manipulates the selected words.<br><br>An event specification can ben

 <p>A number, referring to a particular event

 </p><p>-n

 </p><p>An offset, referring to the event n before the current event

 </p><p>#

 </p><p>The current event. This should be used carefully in <b>csh</b>(1), where there is no check for recursion. tcsh allows 10 levels of recursion. (+)

 </p><p>!

 </p><p>The previous event (equivalent to -1)

 </p><p>s

 </p><p>The most recent event whose first word begins with the string s

 </p><p>?s?

 </p><p>The most recent event which contains the string s. The second ? can be omitted if it is immediately followed by a newline.
 </p>For example, consider this bit of someones history list:
 9 8:30 nroff -man wumpus.man10 8:31 cp wumpus.man wumpus.man.old<br>
 11 8:36 vi wumpus.man<br>
 12 8:37 diff wumpus.man.old wumpus.manThe commands are shown with their event numbers and time stamps. The current event, which we havent typed in yet, is event 13. !11 and !-2 refer to
 event 11. !! refers to the previous event, 12. !! can be abbreviated ! if it is followed by : (: is described below). !n refers to event 9, which
 begins with n. !?old? also refers to event 12, which contains old. Without word designators or modifiers history references simply expand to the entire
 event, so we might type !cp to redo the copy command or !!|more if the diff output scrolled off the top of the screen.
 <br><br>History references may be insulated from the surrounding text with braces if necessary. For example, !vdoc would look for a command beginning with vdoc,
 and, in this example, not find one, but !{v}doc would expand unambiguously to vi wumpus.mandoc. Even in braces, history substitutions do not nest.<br><br>(+) While <b>csh</b>(1) expands, for example, !3d to event 3 with the letter d appended to it, tcsh expands it to the last event beginning with
 3d; only completely numeric arguments are treated as event numbers. This makes it possible to recall events beginning with numbers. To expand !3d as in
 <b>csh</b>(1) say !{3}d.<br><br>To select words from an event we can follow the event specification by a : and a designator for the desired words. The words of an input line are numbered
 from 0, the first (usually command) word being 0, the second word (first argument) being 1, etc. The basic word designators are:0

 <p>The first (command) word

 </p><p>n

 </p><p>The nth argument

 </p><p>^

 </p><p>The first argument, equivalent to 1

 </p><p>$

 </p><p>The last argument

 </p><p>%

 </p><p>The word matched by an ?s? search

 </p><p>x-y

 </p><p>A range of words

 </p><p>-y

 </p><p>Equivalent to 0-y

 </p><p>*

 </p><p>Equivalent to ^-$, but returns nothing if the event contains only 1 word

 </p><p>x*

 </p><p>Equivalent to x-$

 </p><p>x-

 </p><p>Equivalent to x*, but omitting the last word ($)
 </p>Selected words are inserted into the command line separated by single blanks. For example, the diff command in the previous example might have been typed
 as diff !!:1.old !!:1 (using :1 to select the first argument from the previous event) or diff !-2:2 !-2:1 to select and swap the arguments from the cp
 command. If we didnt care about the order of the diff we might have said diff !-2:1-2 or simply diff !-2:*. The cp command might have been written cp
 wumpus.man !#:1.old, using # to refer to the current event. !n:- hurkle.man would reuse the first two words from the nroff command to say nroff -man
 hurkle.man.
 <br><br>The : separating the event specification from the word designator can be omitted if the argument selector begins with a ^, $, *, % or -. For
 example, our diff command might have been diff !!^.old !!^ or, equivalently, diff !!$.old !!$. However, if !! is abbreviated !, an argument selector
 beginning with - will be interpreted as an event specification.<br><br>A history reference may have a word designator but no event specification. It then references the previous command. Continuing our diff example, we could
 have said simply diff !^.old !^ or, to get the arguments in the opposite order, just diff !*.<br><br>The word or words in a history reference can be edited, or modified, by following it with one or more modifiers, each preceded by a ::h

 </p><p>Substitute l for r. l is simply a string like r, not a regular expression as in the eponymous <b><a href=ed>ed</a></b>(1) command. Any
 character may be used as the delimiter in place of /; a \ can be used to quote the delimiter expect (, ), | and &gt; inside l and r.
 The character &amp; in the r is replaced by l; \ also quotes &amp;. If l is empty (), the l from a previous substitution
 or the s from a previous search or event number in event specification is used. The trailing delimiter may be omitted if it is immediately followed by a
 newline.

 </p><p>a (+)

 </p><p>Apply the following modifier as many times as possible to a single word. a and g can be used together to apply a modifier globally. With the s
 modifier, only the patterns contained in the original word are substituted, not patterns that contain any substitution result.

 </p>Modifiers are applied to only the first modifiable word (unless g is used). It is an error for no word to be modifiable.
 <br><br>For example, the diff command might have been written as diff wumpus.man.old !#^:r, using :r to remove .old from the first argument on the same line
 (!#^). We could say echo hello out there, then echo !*:u to capitalize hello, echo !*:au to say it out loud, or echo !*:agu to really shout. We
 might follow mail -s I forgot my password rot with !:s/rot/root to correct the spelling of root (but see <b>Spelling correction</b> for a different
 approach).<br><br>There is a special abbreviation for substitutions. ^, when it is the first character on an input line, is equivalent to !:s^. Thus we might have said
 ^rot^root to make the spelling correction in the previous example. This is the only history substitution which does not explicitly begin with !.<br><br>(+) In csh as such, only one modifier may be applied to each history or variable expansion. In tcsh, more than one may be used, for
 example% mv wumpus.man /usr/man/man1/wumpus.1% man !$:t:r<br>
 man wumpusIn &gt; mv a.out /usr/games/wumpus&gt; setenv PATH !$:h:$PATH<br>
 Bad ! modifier: $.<br>
 &gt; setenv PATH !{-2$:h}:$PATH<br>
 setenv PATH /usr/games:/bin:/usr/bin:.The first attempt would succeed in <br><br>Finally, history can be accessed through the editor as well as through the substitutions just described. The up- and down-history,
 history-search-backward and -forward, i-search-back and -fwd, vi-search-back and -fwd, copy-prev-word and
 insert-last-word editor commands search for events in the history list and copy them into the input buffer. The toggle-literal-history editor
 command switches between the expanded and literal forms of history lines in the input buffer. expand-history and expand-line expand history
 substitutions in the current word and in the entire input buffer respectively.

 <br><br><b>Alias substitution</b>
 Commands) the first word of each command, left-to-right, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so, the first word is
 replaced by the alias. If the alias contains a history reference, it undergoes History substitution (q.v.) as though the original command were the
 previous input line. If the alias does not contain a history reference, the argument list is left untouched.
 <br><br>Thus if the alias for ls were ls -l the command ls /usr would become ls -l /usr, the argument list here being undisturbed. If the alias for lookup
 were grep !^ /etc/passwd then lookup bill would become grep bill /etc/passwd. Aliases can be used to introduce parser metasyntax. For example, alias
 print pr \!* | lpr defines a command (print) which <b><a href=pr>pr</a></b>(1)s its arguments to the line printer.<br><br>Alias substitution is repeated until the first word of the command has no alias. If an alias substitution does not change the first word (as in the previous
 example) it is flagged to prevent a loop. Other loops are detected and cause an error.<br><br>Some aliases are referred to by the shell; see <b>Special aliases</b>.

 <br><br><b>Variable substitution</b>
 <br><br>(+) Variables may be made read-only with set -r (q.v.) Read-only variables may not be modified or unset; attempting to do so will cause an error. Once
 made read-only, a variable cannot be made writable, so set -r should be used with caution. Environment variables cannot be made read-only.<br><br>Some variables are set by the shell or referred to by it. For instance, the <b>argv</b> variable is an image of the shells argument list, and words of this
 variables value are referred to in special ways. Some of the variables referred to by the shell are toggles; the shell does not care what their value is, only
 whether they are set or not. For instance, the <b>verbose</b> variable is a toggle which causes command input to be echoed. The <b>-v</b> command line option
 sets this variable. <b>Special shell variables</b> lists all variables which are referred to by the shell.<br><br>Other operations treat variables numerically. The @ command permits numeric calculations to be performed and the result assigned to a variable. Variable
 values are, however, always represented as (zero or more) strings. For the purposes of numeric operations, the null string is considered to be zero, and the
 second and subsequent words of multi-word values are ignored.<br><br>After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before each command is executed, variable substitution is performed keyed by $ characters. This expansion
 can be prevented by preceding the $ with a \ except within s where it always occurs, and within s where it never occurs. Strings quoted
 by  are interpreted later (see <b>Command substitution</b> below) so $ substitution does not occur there until later, if at all. A $ is passed unchanged
 if followed by a blank, tab, or end-of-line.<br><br>Input/output redirections are recognized before variable expansion, and are variable expanded separately. Otherwise, the command name and entire argument
 list are expanded together. It is thus possible for the first (command) word (to this point) to generate more than one word, the first of which becomes the
 command name, and the rest of which become arguments.<br><br>Unless enclosed in  or given the :q modifier the results of variable substitution may eventually be command and filename substituted. Within , a
 variable whose value consists of multiple words expands to a (portion of a) single word, with the words of the variables value separated by blanks. When the
 :q modifier is applied to a substitution the variable will expand to multiple words with each word separated by a blank and quoted to prevent later command
 or filename substitution.<br><br>The following metasequences are provided for introducing variable values into the shell input. Except as noted, it is an error to reference a variable which
 is not set.<br><br>$name${<br><br>Substitutes the words of the value of variable name, each separated by a blank. Braces insulate name from following characters which would
 otherwise be part of it. Shell variables have names consisting of letters and digits starting with a letter. The underscore character is considered a letter.
 If name is not a shell variable, but is set in the environment, then that value is returned (but some of the other forms given below are not available
 in this case).$Substitutes only the selected words from the value of name. The selector is subjected to $ substitution and may consist of a single number
 or two numbers separated by a -. The first word of a variables value is numbered 1. If the first number of a range is omitted it defaults to 1. If the
 last member of a range is omitted it defaults to $#name. The selector * selects all words. It is not an error for a range to be empty if the
 second argument is omitted or in range.$0

 <br><br>Equivalent to $argv, which is equivalent to $argv[*].The : modifiers described under History substitution, except for :p, can be applied to the substitutions above. More than one may be used. (+)
 Braces may be needed to insulate a variable substitution from a literal colon just as with History substitution (q.v.); any modifiers must appear within
 the braces.

 csh always quotes $&lt;, as if it were equivalent to $&lt;:q, tcsh does not. Furthermore, when tcsh is waiting for a line to be typed
 the user may type an interrupt to interrupt the sequence into which the line is to be substituted, but csh does not allow this.The editor command <br><br><b>Command, filename and directory stack substitution</b>
 <br><br><b>Command substitution</b>
 <br><br>Command substitutions inside double quotes () retain blanks and tabs; only newlines force new words. The single final newline does not force a new word
 in any case. It is thus possible for a command substitution to yield only part of a word, even if the command outputs a complete line.<br><br>By default, the shell since version 6.12 replaces all newline and carriage return characters in the command by spaces. If this is switched off by unsetting
 <b>csubstnonl</b>, newlines separate commands as usual.

 <br><br><b>Filename substitution</b>
 <br><br>In matching filenames, the character . at the beginning of a filename or immediately following a /, as well as the character / must be matched
 explicitly. The character * matches any string of characters, including the null string. The character ? matches any single character. The sequence [...]
 matches any one of the characters enclosed. Within [...], a pair of characters separated by - matches any character lexically between the two.<br><br>(+) Some glob-patterns can be negated: The sequence [^...] matches any single character not specified by the characters and/or ranges of characters
 in the braces.<br><br>An entire glob-pattern can also be negated with ^:&gt; echo *bang crash crunch ouch<br>
 &gt; echo ^cr*<br>
 bang ouchGlob-patterns which do not use ?, *, or [] or which use {} or ~ (below) are not negated correctly.
 <br><br>The metanotation a{b,c,d}e is a shorthand for abe ace ade. Left-to-right order is preserved: /usr/source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c expands to
 /usr/source/s1/oldls.c /usr/source/s1/ls.c. The results of matches are sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order: ../{memo,*box} might expand
 to ../memo ../box ../mbox. (Note that memo was not sorted with the results of matching *box.) It is not an error when this construct expands to files
 which do not exist, but it is possible to get an error from a command to which the expanded list is passed. This construct may be nested. As a special case the
 words {, } and {} are passed undisturbed.<br><br>The character ~ at the beginning of a filename refers to home directories. Standing alone, i.e., ~, it expands to the invokers home directory as
 reflected in the value of the <b>home</b> shell variable. When followed by a name consisting of letters, digits and - characters the shell searches for a
 user with that name and substitutes their home directory; thus ~ken might expand to /usr/ken and ~ken/chmach to /usr/ken/chmach. If the character ~
 is followed by a character other than a letter or / or appears elsewhere than at the beginning of a word, it is left undisturbed. A command like setenv
 MANPATH /usr/man:/usr/local/man:~/lib/man does not, therefore, do home directory substitution as one might hope.<br><br>It is an error for a glob-pattern containing *, ?, [ or ~, with or without ^, not to match any files. However, only one pattern in a list of
 glob-patterns must match a file (so that, e.g., rm *.a *.c *.o would fail only if there were no files in the current directory ending in .a, .c, or
 .o), and if the <b>nonomatch</b> shell variable is set a pattern (or list of patterns) which matches nothing is left unchanged rather than causing an error.<br><br>The <b>noglob</b> shell variable can be set to prevent filename substitution, and the expand-glob editor command, normally bound to ^X-*, can be
 used to interactively expand individual filename substitutions.

 <br><br><b>Directory stack substitution (+)</b>
 savedirs and dirsfile shell variables can be set to store
 the directory stack automatically on logout and restore it on login. The dirstack shell variable can be examined to see the directory stack and set to
 put arbitrary directories into the directory stack.
 <br><br>The character = followed by one or more digits expands to an entry in the directory stack. The special case =- expands to the last directory in the
 stack. For example,&gt; dirs -v0 /usr/bin<br>
 1 /usr/spool/uucp<br>
 2 /usr/accts/sys<br>
 &gt; echo =1<br>
 /usr/spool/uucp<br>
 &gt; echo =0/calendar<br>
 /usr/bin/calendar<br>
 &gt; echo =-<br>
 /usr/accts/sysThe noglob and nonomatch shell variables and the <br><br><b>Other substitutions (+)</b>
 symlinks variable (q.v.) is set to expand. Quoting prevents this expansion, and the owd). This is not a substitution at all, but an abbreviation recognized by
 only those commands. Nonetheless, it too can be prevented by quoting.
 <br><br><b>Commands</b>
 <br><br><b>Simple commands, pipelines and sequences</b>
 <br><br>Simple commands and pipelines may be joined into sequences with ;, and will be executed sequentially. Commands and pipelines can also be joined into
 sequences with || or &amp;&amp;, indicating, as in the C language, that the second is to be executed only if the first fails or succeeds respectively.<br><br>A simple command, pipeline or sequence may be placed in parentheses, (), to form a simple command, which may in turn be a component of a pipeline or
 sequence. A command, pipeline or sequence can be executed without waiting for it to terminate by following it with an &amp;.

 <br><br><b>Builtin and non-builtin command execution</b>
 <br><br>Parenthesized commands are always executed in a subshell.(cd; pwd); pwdthus prints the home directory, leaving you where you were (printing this after the home directory), while
 cd; pwdleaves you in the home directory. Parenthesized commands are most often used to prevent <br><br>When a command to be executed is found not to be a builtin command the shell attempts to execute the command via <b><a href=/man/2/execve rel=nofollow>execve</a></b>(2). Each word in the variable
 <b>path</b> names a directory in which the shell will look for the command. If the shell is not given a <b>-f</b> option, the shell hashes the names in these
 directories into an internal table so that it will try an <b><a href=/man/2/execve rel=nofollow>execve</a></b>(2) in only a directory where there is a possibility that the command resides there.
 This greatly speeds command location when a large number of directories are present in the search path. This hashing mechanism is not used:1.

 <br><br>If hashing is turned explicitly off via unhash.<br><br><b>2.</b><br><br>If the shell was given a <b>-f</b> argument.<br><br><b>3.</b><br><br>For each directory component of <b>path</b> which does not begin with a /.<br><br><b>4.</b><br><br>If the command contains a /.In the above four cases the shell concatenates each component of the path vector with the given command name to form a path name of a file which it then
 attempts to execute it. If execution is successful, the search stops.
 <br><br>If the file has execute permissions but is not an executable to the system (i.e., it is neither an executable binary nor a script that specifies its
 interpreter), then it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands and a new shell is spawned to read it. The shell special alias may be set to
 specify an interpreter other than the shell itself.<br><br>On systems which do not understand the #! script interpreter convention the shell may be compiled to emulate it; see the <b>version</b> shell variable. If
 so, the shell checks the first line of the file to see if it is of the form #!interpreter arg .... If it is, the shell starts interpreter with
 the given args and feeds the file to it on standard input.

 <br><br><b>Input/output</b>
 <br><br>Open file name (which is first variable, command and filename expanded) as the standard input.<br><br>&lt;&lt; word<br><br>Read the shell input up to a line which is identical to word. word is not subjected to variable, filename or command substitution, and each

 blanks, tabs, and newlines preserved, except for the final newline which is dropped. The resultant text is placed in an anonymous temporary file which is given
 to the command as standard input.>
 >! name
 >& nameThe file name is used as standard output. If the file does not exist then it is created; if the file exists, it is truncated, its previous contents
 being lost.If the shell variable <b>noclobber</b> is set, then the file must not exist or be a character special file (e.g., a terminal or /dev/null) or an error
 results. This helps prevent accidental destruction of files. In this case the ! forms can be used to suppress this check.

 exist, unless one of the ! forms is given.A command receives the environment in which the shell was invoked as modified by the input-output parameters and the presence of the command in a pipeline.
 Thus, unlike some previous shells, commands run from a file of shell commands have no access to the text of the commands by default; rather they receive the
 original standard input of the shell. The << mechanism should be used to present inline data. This permits shell command scripts to function as
 components of pipelines and allows the shell to block read its input. Note that the default standard input for a command run detached is Jobs).
 <br><br>Diagnostic output may be directed through a pipe with the standard output. Simply use the form |&amp; rather than just |.<br><br>The shell cannot presently redirect diagnostic output without also redirecting standard output, but (command &gt; output-file) &gt;&amp;
 error-file is often an acceptable workaround. Either output-file or error-file may be /dev/tty to send output to the terminal.

 <br><br><b>Features</b>
 <br><br><b>Control flow</b>
 <br><br>The foreach, switch, and while statements, as well as the if-then-else form of the if statement, require that the major
 keywords appear in a single simple command on an input line as shown below.<br><br>If the shells input is not seekable, the shell buffers up input whenever a loop is being read and performs seeks in this internal buffer to accomplish the
 rereading implied by the loop. (To the extent that this allows, backward gotos will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)

 <br><br><b>Expressions</b>
 <br><br><b>Logical, arithmetical and comparison operators</b>
 || &amp;&amp; | ^ &amp; == != =~ !~ &lt;= &gt;=&lt; &gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; + - * / % ! ~ ( )Here the precedence increases to the right, == != =~ and !~, <= >= < and >, << and >>, + and -, * / and
 % being, in groups, at the same level. When multiple operators which have same precedence are used in one expression, calculation must be done from operator
 of right side. The == != =~ and !~ operators compare their arguments as strings; all others operate on numbers. The operators =~ and !~ are like
 != and == except that the right hand side is a glob-pattern (see Filename substitution) against which the left hand operand is matched. This reduces
 the need for use of the <br><br>Null or missing arguments are considered 0. The results of all expressions are strings, which represent decimal numbers. It is important to note that no
 two components of an expression can appear in the same word; except when adjacent to components of expressions which are syntactically significant to the
 parser (&amp; | &lt; &gt; ( )) they should be surrounded by spaces.

 writing but which is on a file system mounted read-only, the test will succeed in a POSIX shell but fail in a non-POSIX shell.<br><br>File inquiry operators can also be evaluated with the filetest builtin command (q.v.) (+).

 <br><br><b>Jobs</b>
 [1] 1234indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number 1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.
 <br><br>If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the suspend key (usually ^Z), which sends a STOP signal to the current job. The shell
 will then normally indicate that the job has been Suspended and print another prompt. If the <b>listjobs</b> shell variable is set, all jobs will be listed
 like the jobs builtin command; if it is set to long the listing will be in long format, like jobs -l. You can then manipulate the state of the
 suspended job. You can put it in the background with the bg command or run some other commands and eventually bring the job back into the
 foreground with fg. (See also the run-fg-editor editor command.) A ^Z takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending
 output and unread input are discarded when it is typed. The wait builtin command causes the shell to wait for all background jobs to complete.<br><br>The ^] key sends a delayed suspend signal, which does not generate a STOP signal until a program attempts to <b><a href=/man/2/read>read</a></b>(2) it, to the current job. This
 can usefully be typed ahead when you have prepared some commands for a job which you wish to stop after it has read them. The ^Y key performs this function
 in <b>csh</b>(1); in tcsh, ^Y is an editing command. (+)<br><br>A job being run in the background stops if it tries to read from the terminal. Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but this can be
 disabled by giving the command stty tostop. If you set this tty option, then background jobs will stop when they try to produce output like they do when they
 try to read input.<br><br>There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell. The character % introduces a job name. If you wish to refer to job number 1, you can name it as
 %1. Just naming a job brings it to the foreground; thus %1 is a synonym for fg %1, bringing job 1 back into the foreground. Similarly, saying %1 &amp;
 resumes job 1 in the background, just like bg %1. A job can also be named by an unambiguous prefix of the string typed in to start it: %ex would normally
 restart a suspended <b><a href=ex>ex</a></b>(1) job, if there were only one suspended job whose name began with the string ex. It is also possible to say %?string
 to specify a job whose text contains string, if there is only one such job.<br><br>The shell maintains a notion of the current and previous jobs. In output pertaining to jobs, the current job is marked with a + and the previous job with
 a -. The abbreviations %+, %, and (by analogy with the syntax of the history mechanism) %% all refer to the current job, and %- refers to the
 previous job.<br><br>The job control mechanism requires that the <b><a href=stty rel=nofollow>stty</a></b>(1) option new be set on some systems. It is an artifact from a new implementation of the tty
 driver which allows generation of interrupt characters from the keyboard to tell jobs to stop. See <b><a href=stty rel=nofollow>stty</a></b>(1) and the setty builtin command for
 details on setting options in the new tty driver.

 <br><br><b>Status reporting</b>
 notify, the shell will notify you immediately of changes of status in background jobs. There is also a shell command <br><br>When you try to leave the shell while jobs are stopped, you will be warned that There are suspended jobs. You may use the jobs command to see what
 they are. If you do this or immediately try to exit again, the shell will not warn you a second time, and the suspended jobs will be terminated.

 <br><br><b>Native Language System support (+)</b>
 version shell variable) and thus supports character sets needing this capability. NLS support
 differs depending on whether or not the shell was compiled to use the systems NLS (again, see version). In either case, 7-bit ASCII is the default
 character code (e.g., the classification of which characters are printable) and sorting, and changing the LANG or LC_CTYPE environment variables
 causes a check for possible changes in these respects.
 <br><br>When using the systems NLS, the <b><a href=/man/3/setlocale rel=nofollow>setlocale</a></b>(3) function is called to determine appropriate character code/classification and sorting (e.g., a
 en_CA.UTF-8 would yield UTF-8 as a character code). This function typically examines the <b>LANG</b> and <b>LC_CTYPE</b> environment variables; refer to
 the system documentation for further details. When not using the systems NLS, the shell simulates it by assuming that the ISO 8859-1 character set is used
 whenever either of the <b>LANG</b> and <b>LC_CTYPE</b> variables are set, regardless of their values. Sorting is not affected for the simulated NLS.<br><br>In addition, with both real and simulated NLS, all printable characters in the range \200-\377, i.e., those that have M-char bindings, are
 automatically rebound to self-insert-command. The corresponding binding for the escape-char sequence, if any, is left alone. These characters are
 not rebound if the <b>NOREBIND</b> environment variable is set. This may be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive real NLS which assumes full ISO 8859-1.
 Otherwise, all M-char bindings in the range \240-\377 are effectively undone. Explicitly rebinding the relevant keys with bindkey is of course
 still possible.<br><br>Unknown characters (i.e., those that are neither printable nor control characters) are printed in the format \nnn. If the tty is not in 8 bit mode, other 8
 bit characters are printed by converting them to ASCII and using standout mode. The shell never changes the 7/8 bit mode of the tty and tracks user-initiated
 changes of 7/8 bit mode. NLS users (or, for that matter, those who want to use a meta key) may need to explicitly set the tty in 8 bit mode through the
 appropriate <b><a href=stty rel=nofollow>stty</a></b>(1) command in, e.g., the ~/.login file.

 <br><br><b>Signal handling</b>
 -q. Login shells catch the
 terminate signal, but non-login shells inherit the terminate behavior from their parents. Other signals have the values which the shell inherited from its
 parent.
 <br><br>In shell scripts, the shells handling of interrupt and terminate signals can be controlled with onintr, and its handling of hangups can be
 controlled with hup and nohup.<br><br>The shell exits on a hangup (see also the <b>logout</b> shell variable). By default, the shells children do too, but the shell does not send them a hangup
 when it exits. hup arranges for the shell to send a hangup to a child when it exits, and nohup sets a child to ignore hangups.

 <br><br><b>Terminal management (+)</b>
 <br><br>The echotc, settc and telltc commands can be used to manipulate and debug terminal capabilities from the command line.<br><br>On systems that support SIGWINCH or SIGWINDOW, the shell adapts to window resizing automatically and adjusts the environment variables <b>LINES</b> and

 size.

 to build more sophisticated completions (see completion for <b><a href=svn>svn</a></b>(1) included in this package).
 </p><p>Now for some examples. Some commands take only directories as arguments, so theres no point completing plain files.
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; complete cd p/1/d/
 completes only the first word following cd (p/1) with a directory. <b>p</b>-type completion can also be used to narrow down command completion:

 <br><br>&gt; co[^D]
 complete compress<br>
 &gt; complete -co* p/0/(compress)/<br>
 &gt; co[^D]<br>
 &gt; compressThis completion completes commands (words in position 0, p/0) which begin with co (thus matching co*) to compress (the only word in the list). The
 leading - indicates that this completion is to be used with only ambiguous commands.

 <br><br>&gt; complete find n/-user/u/
 is an example of <b>n</b>-type completion. Any word following find and immediately following -user is completed from the list of users.

 <br><br>&gt; complete cc c/-I/d/
 demonstrates <b>c</b>-type completion. Any word following cc and beginning with -I is completed as a directory. -I is not taken as part of the
 directory because we used lowercase <b>c</b>.
 <p>Different lists are useful with different commands.
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; complete alias p/1/a/
 &gt; complete man p/*/c/<br>
 &gt; complete set p/1/s/<br>
 &gt; complete true p/1/x:Truth has no options./These complete words following alias with aliases, man with commands, and set with shell variables. true doesnt have any options, so <b>x</b> does
 nothing when completion is attempted and prints Truth has no options. when completion choices are listed.
 <p>Note that the man example, and several other examples below, could just as well have used c/* or n/* as p/*.
 </p><p>Words can be completed from a variable evaluated at completion time,
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; complete ftp p/1/$hostnames/
 &gt; set hostnames = (rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu)<br>
 &gt; ftp [^D]<br>
 rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu<br>
 &gt; ftp [^C]<br>
 &gt; set hostnames = (rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu uunet.uu.net)<br>
 &gt; ftp [^D]<br>
 rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu uunet.uu.netor from a command run at completion time:

 <br><br>&gt; complete kill p/*/ps | awk \{print\ \$1\}/
 &gt; kill -9 [^D]<br>
 23113 23377 23380 23406 23429 23529 23530 PIDNote that the complete command does not itself quote its arguments, so the braces, space and $ in {print $1} must be quoted explicitly.

 <p>One command can have multiple completions:
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; complete dbx p/2/(core)/ p/*/c/
 completes the second argument to dbx with the word core and all other arguments with commands. Note that the positional completion is specified before
 the next-word completion. Because completions are evaluated from left to right, if the next-word completion were specified first it would always match and the
 positional completion would never be executed. This is a common mistake when defining a completion.
 <p>The select pattern is useful when a command takes files with only particular forms as arguments. For example,
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; complete cc p/*/f:*.[cao]/
 completes cc arguments to files ending in only .c, .a, or .o. select can also exclude files, using negation of a glob-pattern as described
 under <b>Filename substitution</b>. One might use

 <br><br>&gt; complete rm p/*/f:^*.{c,h,cc,C,tex,1,man,l,y}/
 to exclude precious source code from rm completion. Of course, one could still type excluded names manually or override the completion mechanism using the
 complete-word-raw or list-choices-raw editor commands (q.v.).
 <p>The C, D, F and T lists are like c, d, f and t respectively, but they use the select argument in a different way: to restrict
 completion to files beginning with a particular path prefix. For example, the Elm mail program uses = as an abbreviation for ones mail directory. One might
 use
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; complete elm c@=@F:$HOME/Mail/@
 to complete elm -f = as if it were elm -f ~/Mail/. Note that we used @ instead of / to avoid confusion with the select argument, and we used
 $HOME instead of ~ because home directory substitution works at only the beginning of a word.
 <p>suffix is used to add a nonstandard suffix (not space or / for directories) to completed words.
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; complete finger c/*@/$hostnames/ p/1/u/@
 completes arguments to finger from the list of users, appends an @, and then completes after the @ from the hostnames variable. Note again the order
 in which the completions are specified.
 <p>Finally, heres a complex example for inspiration:
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; complete find \
 n/-name/f/ n/-newer/f/ n/-{,n}cpio/f/ \<br>
 n/-exec/c/ n/-ok/c/ n/-user/u/ \<br>
 n/-group/g/ n/-fstype/(nfs 4.2)/ \<br>
 n/-type/(b c d f l p s)/ \<br>
 c/-/(name newer cpio ncpio exec ok user \<br>
 group fstype type atime ctime depth inum \<br>
 ls mtime nogroup nouser perm print prune \<br>
 size xdev)/ \<br>
 p/*/d/This completes words following -name, -newer, -cpio or ncpio (note the pattern which matches both) to files, words following -exec or -ok to
 commands, words following user and group to users and groups respectively and words following -fstype or -type to members of the given lists. It also
 completes the switches themselves from the given list (note the use of <b>c</b>-type completion) and completes anything not otherwise completed to a directory.
 Whew.
 <p>Remember that programmed completions are ignored if the word being completed is a tilde substitution (beginning with ~) or a variable (beginning with
 $). complete is an experimental feature, and the syntax may change in future versions of the shell. See also the uncomplete builtin
 command.

 dirs -S|-L [dirs -c (+)
 The first form prints the directory stack. The top of the stack is at the left and the first directory in the stack is the current directory. With
 <b>-l</b>, ~ or ~name in the output is expanded explicitly to <b>home</b> or the pathname of the home directory for user name. (+) With
 <b>-n</b>, entries are wrapped before they reach the edge of the screen. (+) With <b>-v</b>, entries are printed one per line, preceded by their stack
 positions. (+) If more than one of <b>-n</b> or <b>-v</b> is given, <b>-v</b> takes precedence. <b>-p</b> is accepted but does nothing.With <b>-S</b>, the second form saves the directory stack to filename as a series of cd and pushd commands. With <b>-L</b>, the shell
 sources filename, which is presumably a directory stack file saved by the <b>-S</b> option or the <b>savedirs</b> mechanism. In either case,
 <b>dirsfile</b> is used if filename is not given and ~/.cshdirs is used if <b>dirsfile</b> is unset.
 <p>Note that login shells do the equivalent of dirs -L on startup and, if <b>savedirs</b> is set, dirs -S before exiting. Because only ~/.tcshrc is
 normally sourced before ~/.cshdirs, <b>dirsfile</b> should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than ~/.login.
 </p><p>The last form clears the directory stack.

 10 sends it to column 3 and row 10, and echotc ts 0; echo This is a test.; echotc fs prints This is a test. in the status line.If arg is baud, cols, lines, meta or tabs, prints the value of that capability (yes or no indicating that the terminal does or does not
 have that capability). One might use this to make the output from a shell script less verbose on slow terminals, or limit command output to the number of lines
 on the screen:

 <br><br>&gt; set history=echotc lines
 &gt; @ history--Termcap strings may contain wildcards which will not echo correctly. One should use double quotes when setting a shell variable to a terminal capability

 <br><br>&gt; set tosl=echotc ts 0
 &gt; set frsl=echotc fs<br>
 &gt; echo -n $tosl;date; echo -n $frslWith <b>-s</b>, nonexistent capabilities return the empty string rather than causing an error. With <b>-v</b>, messages are verbose.else<br>

 list is printed without leading numbers. If <b>-T</b> is specified, timestamps are printed also in comment form. (This can be used to produce files suitable
 for loading with history -L or source -h.) With <b>-r</b>, the order of printing is most recent first rather than oldest first.With <b>-S</b>, the second form saves the history list to filename. If the first word of the <b>savehist</b> shell variable is set to a number, at
 most that many lines are saved. If the second word of <b>savehist</b> is set to merge, the history list is merged with the existing history file instead of
 replacing it (if there is one) and sorted by time stamp. (+) Merging is intended for an environment like the X Window System with several shells in
 simultaneous use. Currently it succeeds only when the shells quit nicely one after another.
 <p>With <b>-L</b>, the shell appends filename, which is presumably a history list saved by the <b>-S</b> option or the <b>savehist</b> mechanism, to the
 history list. <b>-M</b> is like <b>-L</b>, but the contents of filename are merged into the history list and sorted by timestamp. In either case,
 <b>histfile</b> is used if filename is not given and ~/.history is used if <b>histfile</b> is unset. history -L is exactly like source -h
 except that it does not require a filename.
 </p><p>Note that login shells do the equivalent of history -L on startup and, if <b>savehist</b> is set, history -S before exiting. Because only
 ~/.tcshrc is normally sourced before ~/.history, <b>histfile</b> should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than ~/.login.

 </p><p>If <b>histlit</b> is set, the first and second forms print and save the literal (unexpanded) form of the history list.
 </p><p>The last form clears the history list.
 </p>hup [With command, runs command such that it will exit on a hangup signal and arranges for the shell to send it a hangup signal when the shell
 exits. Note that commands may set their own response to hangups, overriding hup. Without an argument (allowed in only a shell script), causes the shell
 to exit on a hangup for the remainder of the script. See also <b>Signal handling</b> and the nohup builtin command.if (expr) If expr (an expression, as described under <b>Expressions</b>) evaluates true, then command is executed. Variable substitution on
 command happens early, at the same time it does for the rest of the if command. command must be a simple command, not an alias, a
 pipeline, a command list or a parenthesized command list, but it may have arguments. Input/output redirection occurs even if expr is false and
 command is thus not executed; this is a bug.if (expr) then
 ...<br>
 else if (expr2) then
 ...<br>
 else
 ...
 endif

 <br><br>If the specified expr is true then the commands to the first else are executed; otherwise if expr2 is true then the commands to the
 second else are executed, etc. Any number of else-if pairs are possible; only one endif is needed. The else part is likewise
 optional. (The words else and endif must appear at the beginning of input lines; the if must appear alone on its input line or after an
 else.)inlib Adds each shared-library to the current environment. There is no way to remove a shared library. (Domain/OS only)jobs [-l]
 Lists the active jobs. With <b>-l</b>, lists process IDs in addition to the normal information. On TCF systems, prints the site on which each job is
 executing.kill [-s %jobkill -l

 <br><br>The first and second forms sends the specified signal (or, if none is given, the TERM (terminate) signal) to the specified jobs or processes.
 job may be a number, a string, , %, + or - as described under <b>Jobs</b>. Signals are either given by number or by name (as given in
 <a href=/include/signal.h rel=nofollow>/usr/include/signal.h</a>, stripped of the prefix SIG). There is no default job; saying just kill does not send a signal to the current job. If
 the signal being sent is TERM (terminate) or HUP (hangup), then the job or process is sent a CONT (continue) signal as well. The third form lists the signal
 names.limit [-h] [Limits the consumption by the current process and each process it creates to not individually exceed maximum-use on the specified resource. If
 no maximum-use is given, then the current limit is printed; if no resource is given, then all limitations are given. If the <b>-h</b> flag is
 given, the hard limits are used instead of the current limits. The hard limits impose a ceiling on the values of the current limits. Only the super-user may
 raise the hard limits, but a user may lower or raise the current limits within the legal range.Controllable resources currently include (if supported by the OS):cputime

 <br><br>the maximum number of cpu-seconds to be used by each process
 filesize

 <br><br>the largest single file which can be created
 datasize

 <br><br>the maximum growth of the data+stack region via <b><a href=/man/2/sbrk>sbrk</a></b>(2) beyond the end of the program text
 stacksize

 <br><br>the maximum size of the automatically-extended stack region
 coredumpsize

 <br><br>the size of the largest core dump that will be created
 memoryuse

 <br><br>the maximum amount of physical memory a process may have allocated to it at a given time (this is not implemented in the 2.6 kernel. The value is
 meaningless and changing this value will have no effect)
 heapsize

 <br><br>the maximum amount of memory a process may allocate per brk() system call
 descriptors or openfiles

 <br><br>the maximum number of open files for this process
 concurrency

 <br><br>the maximum number of threads for this process
 memorylocked

 <br><br>the maximum size which a process may lock into memory using <b><a href=/man/2/mlock>mlock</a></b>(2)
 maxproc

 <br><br>the maximum number of simultaneous processes for this user id
 sbsize

 <p>the maximum size of socket buffer usage for this user
 </p>swapsize

 <br><br>the maximum amount of swap space reserved or used for this user
 maximum-use may be given as a (floating point or integer) number followed by a scale factor. For all limits other than cputime the default
 scale is k or kilobytes (1024 bytes); a scale factor of m or megabytes may also be used. For cputime the default scaling is seconds, while m
 for minutes or h for hours, or a time of the form mm:ss giving minutes and seconds may be used.
 <p>For both resource names and scale factors, unambiguous prefixes of the names suffice.

 <p>If the <b>listflags</b> shell variable is set to x, a or A, or any combination thereof (e.g., xA), they are used as flags to ls-F, making it
 act like ls -xF, ls -Fa, ls -FA or a combination (e.g., ls -FxA). On machines where ls -C is not the default, ls-F acts like ls -CF, unless
 <b>listflags</b> contains an x, in which case it acts like ls -xF. ls-F passes its arguments to <b><a href=ls rel=nofollow>ls</a></b>(1) if it is given any switches, so alias
 ls ls-F generally does the right thing.
 </p><p>The <b>ls-F</b> builtin can list files using different colors depending on the filetype or extension. See the <b>color</b> tcsh variable and the
 <b>LS_COLORS</b> environment variable.
 </p>migrate [-site%jobidmigrate -siteThe first form migrates the process or job to the site specified or the default site determined by the system path. The second form is equivalent to
 migrate -site $$: it migrates the current process to the specified site. Migrating the shell itself can cause unexpected behavior, because the shell
 does not like to lose its tty. (TCF only)newgrp [-] Equivalent to exec newgrp; see <b><a href=newgrp rel=nofollow>newgrp</a></b>(1). Available only if the shell was so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.nice [+numberSets the scheduling priority for the shell to number, or, without number, to 4. With command, runs command at the appropriate
 priority. The greater the number, the less cpu the process gets. The super-user may specify negative priority by using nice -number .... Command is
 always executed in a sub-shell, and the restrictions placed on commands in simple if statements apply.nohup [With command, runs command such that it will ignore hangup signals. Note that commands may set their own response to hangups, overriding
 nohup. Without an argument (allowed in only a shell script), causes the shell to ignore hangups for the remainder of the script. See also <b>Signal
 handling</b> and the hup builtin command.notify [%jobCauses the shell to notify the user asynchronously when the status of any of the specified jobs (or, without %job, the current job) changes, instead
 of waiting until the next prompt as is usual. job may be a number, a string, , %, + or - as described under <b>Jobs</b>. See also the
 <b>notify</b> shell variable.onintr [-|Controls the action of the shell on interrupts. Without arguments, restores the default action of the shell on interrupts, which is to terminate shell
 scripts or to return to the terminal command input level. With -, causes all interrupts to be ignored. With label, causes the shell to execute a goto
 label when an interrupt is received or a child process terminates because it was interrupted.onintr is ignored if the shell is running detached and in system startup files (see <b>FILES</b>), where interrupts are disabled anyway.popd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v] [+nWithout arguments, pops the directory stack and returns to the new top directory. With a number +n, discards the nth entry in the
 stack.Finally, all forms of popd print the final directory stack, just like dirs. The <b>pushdsilent</b> shell variable can be set to prevent this
 and the <b>-p</b> flag can be given to override <b>pushdsilent</b>. The <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b> and <b>-v</b> flags have the same effect on popd as on
 dirs. (+)printenv [Prints the names and values of all environment variables or, with name, the value of the environment variable name.pushd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v] [+nWithout arguments, exchanges the top two elements of the directory stack. If <b>pushdtohome</b> is set, pushd without arguments does pushd ~, like
 cd. (+) With name, pushes the current working directory onto the directory stack and changes to name. If name is - it is
 interpreted as the previous working directory (see <b>Filename substitution</b>). (+) If <b>dunique</b> is set, pushd removes any instances of
 name from the stack before pushing it onto the stack. (+) With a number +n, rotates the nth element of the directory stack around to be
 the top element and changes to it. If <b>dextract</b> is set, however, pushd +n extracts the nth directory, pushes it onto the top of the stack
 and changes to it. (+)Finally, all forms of pushdsilent shell variable can be set to prevent this

 directories in <b>path</b> while you are logged in. This should be necessary only if you add commands to one of your own directories, or if a systems
 programmer changes the contents of one of the system directories. Also flushes the cache of home directories built by tilde expansion.repeat The specified command, which is subject to the same restrictions as the command in the one line if statement above, is executed
 count times. I/O redirections occur exactly once, even if count is 0.rootnode //nodenameChanges the rootnode to //nodename, so that / will be interpreted as //nodename. (Domain/OS only)sched (+)<br>
 sched [+]sched -nThe first form prints the scheduled-event list. The <b>sched</b> shell variable may be set to define the format in which the scheduled-event list is
 printed. The second form adds command to the scheduled-event list. For example,

 <br><br>&gt; sched 11:00 echo It\s eleven o\clock.
 causes the shell to echo Its eleven oclock. at 11 AM. The time may be in 12-hour AM/PM format

 <br><br>&gt; sched 5pm set prompt=[%h] It\s after 5; go home: &gt;
 or may be relative to the current time:

 <br><br>&gt; sched +2:15 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother
 A relative time specification may not use AM/PM format. The third form removes item n from the event list:

 <br><br>&gt; sched
 1 Wed Apr 4 15:42 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother<br>
 2 Wed Apr 4 17:00 set prompt=[%h] Its after 5; go home: &gt;<br>
 &gt; sched -2<br>
 &gt; sched<br>
 1 Wed Apr 4 15:42 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sotherA command in the scheduled-event list is executed just before the first prompt is printed after the time when the command is scheduled. It is possible to
 miss the exact time when the command is to be run, but an overdue command will execute at the next prompt. A command which comes due while the shell is waiting
 for user input is executed immediately. However, normal operation of an already-running command will not be interrupted so that a scheduled-event list element
 may be run.
 <p>This mechanism is similar to, but not the same as, the <b><a href=at>at</a></b>(1) command on some Unix systems. Its major disadvantage is that it may not run a command at
 exactly the specified time. Its major advantage is that because sched runs directly from the shell, it has access to shell variables and other
 structures. This provides a mechanism for changing ones working environment based on the time of day.

 set <br>
 set =word<br>
 set [-r] [-f|-l] =(wordlist) ... (+)<br>
 set =word<br>
 set -r (+)<br>
 set -r set -r =wordThe first form of the command prints the value of all shell variables. Variables which contain more than a single word print as a parenthesized word list.
 The second form sets name to the null string. The third form sets name to the single word. The fourth form sets name to the list of
 words in wordlist. In all cases the value is command and filename expanded. If -r is specified, the value is set read-only. If -f or -l are specified,
 set only unique words keeping their order. -f prefers the first occurrence of a word, and -l the last. The fifth form sets the indexth component of
 name to word; this component must already exist. The sixth form lists only the names of all shell variables that are read-only. The seventh form makes
 name read-only, whether or not it has a value. The eighth form is the same as the third form, but make name read-only at the same time.These arguments can be repeated to set and/or make read-only multiple variables in a single set command. Note, however, that variable expansion happens for
 all arguments before any setting occurs. Note also that = can be adjacent to both name and word or separated from both by whitespace, but
 cannot be adjacent to only one or the other. See also the unset builtin command.setenv [Without arguments, prints the names and values of all environment variables. Given name, sets the environment variable name to value
 or, without value, to the null string.setpath Equivalent to <b>setpath</b>(1). (Mach only)setspath LOCAL|Sets the system execution path. (TCF only)settc Tells the shell to believe that the terminal capability cap (as defined in <b><a href=/man/5/termcap rel=nofollow>termcap</a></b>(5)) has the value value. No sanity checking is done.
 Concept terminal users may have to settc xn no to get proper wrapping at the rightmost column.setty [-d|-q|-x] [-a] [[+|-]Controls which tty modes (see <b>Terminal management</b>) the shell does not allow to change. <b>-d</b>, <b>-q</b> or <b>-x</b> tells setty to act on
 the edit, quote or execute set of tty modes respectively; without <b>-d</b>, <b>-q</b> or <b>-x</b>, execute is used.Without other arguments, setty lists the modes in the chosen set which are fixed on (+mode) or off (-mode). The available modes, and thus the
 display, vary from system to system. With <b>-a</b>, lists all tty modes in the chosen set whether or not they are fixed. With <b>+</b>mode,
 <b>-</b>mode or mode, fixes mode on or off or removes control from mode in the chosen set. For example, setty +echok echoe fixes
 echok mode on and allows commands to turn echoe mode on or off, both when the shell is executing commands.setxvers [Set the experimental version prefix to string, or removes it if string is omitted. (TCF only)shift [Without arguments, discards <b>argv</b>[1] and shifts the members of <b>argv</b> to the left. It is an error for <b>argv</b> not to be set or to have less
 than one word as value. With variable, performs the same function on variable.source [-h] The shell reads and executes commands from name. The commands are not placed on the history list. If any args are given, they are placed in
 <b>argv</b>. (+) source commands may be nested; if they are nested too deeply the shell may run out of file descriptors. An error in a source at
 any level terminates all nested source commands. With <b>-h</b>, commands are placed on the history list instead of being executed, much like history
 -L.stop %jobStops the specified jobs or processes which are executing in the background. job may be a number, a string, , %, + or - as described under
 <b>Jobs</b>. There is no default job; saying just stop does not stop the current job.suspend

 <br><br>Causes the shell to stop in its tracks, much as if it had been sent a stop signal with <b>^Z</b>. This is most often used to stop shells started by
 <b><a href=su rel=nofollow>su</a></b>(1).switch (string)<br>
 case :
 ...<b>breaksw</b>...<br>
 default:
 ...<b>breaksw</b>endsw

 <br><br>Each case label is successively matched, against the specified string which is first command and filename expanded. The file metacharacters *, ?
 and [...] may be used in the case labels, which are variable expanded. If none of the labels match before a default label is found, then the execution
 begins after the default label. Each case label and the default label must appear at the beginning of a line. The command breaksw causes execution to
 continue after the endsw. Otherwise control may fall through case labels and default labels as in C. If no label matches and there is no default,
 execution continues after the endsw.telltc (+)
 Lists the values of all terminal capabilities (see <b><a href=/man/5/termcap rel=nofollow>termcap</a></b>(5)).termname [Tests if terminal type (or the current value of <b>TERM</b> if no terminal type is given) has an entry in the hosts <b><a href=/man/5/termcap>termcap</a></b>(5) or <b><a href=/man/5/terminfo>terminfo</a></b>(5)
 database. Prints the terminal type to stdout and returns 0 if an entry is present otherwise returns 1.time [Executes command (which must be a simple command, not an alias, a pipeline, a command list or a parenthesized command list) and prints a time summary
 as described under the <b>time</b> variable. If necessary, an extra shell is created to print the time statistic when the command completes. Without
 command, prints a time summary for the current shell and its children.umask [Sets the file creation mask to value, which is given in octal. Common values for the mask are 002, giving all access to the group and read and
 execute access to others, and 022, giving read and execute access to the group and others. Without value, prints the current file creation mask.unalias Removes all aliases whose names match pattern. unalias * thus removes all aliases. It is not an error for nothing to be unaliased.uncomplete Removes all completions whose names match pattern. uncomplete * thus removes all completions. It is not an error for nothing to be
 uncompleted.unhash

 <br><br>Disables use of the internal hash table to speed location of executed programs.universe Sets the universe to universe. (Masscomp/RTU only)unlimit [-hf] [Removes the limitation on resource or, if no resource is specified, all resource limitations. With <b>-h</b>, the corresponding hard
 limits are removed. Only the super-user may do this. Note that <b>unlimit</b> may not exit successful, since most systems do not allow descriptors to be
 unlimited. With <b>-f</b> errors are ignored.unset Removes all variables whose names match pattern, unless they are read-only. unset * thus removes all variables unless they are read-only; this is a
 bad idea. It is not an error for nothing to be unset.unsetenv Removes all environment variables whose names match pattern. unsetenv * thus removes all environment variables; this is a bad idea. It is not an
 error for nothing to be unsetenved.ver [Without arguments, prints <b>SYSTYPE</b>. With systype, sets <b>SYSTYPE</b> to systype. With systype and command, executes
 command under systype. systype may be bsd4.3 or sys5.3. (Domain/OS only)wait

 <br><br>The shell waits for all background jobs. If the shell is interactive, an interrupt will disrupt the wait and cause the shell to print the names and job
 numbers of all outstanding jobs.warp Sets the universe to universe. (Convex/OS only)watchlog (+)
 An alternate name for the log builtin command (q.v.). Available only if the shell was so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.where Reports all known instances of command, including aliases, builtins and executables in <b>path</b>.which Displays the command that will be executed by the shell after substitutions, <b>path</b> searching, etc. The builtin command is just like <b><a href=which>which</a></b>(1),
 but it correctly reports tcsh aliases and builtins and is 10 to 100 times faster. See also the which-command editor command.while (expr)
 ...
 end

 <br><br>Executes the commands between the while and the matching end while expr (an expression, as described under <b>Expressions</b>)
 evaluates non-zero. while and end must appear alone on their input lines. break and continue may be used to terminate or continue
 the loop prematurely. If the input is a terminal, the user is prompted the first time through the loop as with foreach.

 <br><br><b>Special aliases (+)</b>
 beepcmd

 <br><br>Runs when the shell wants to ring the terminal bell.<br><br><b>cwdcmd</b><br><br>Runs after every change of working directory. For example, if the user is working on an X window system using <b><a href=xterm>xterm</a></b>(1) and a re-parenting window
 manager that supports title bars such as <b><a href=twm>twm</a></b>(1) and does<br><br>&gt; alias cwdcmd echo -n ^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd ^Gthen the shell will change the title of the running <b><a href=xterm rel=nofollow>xterm</a></b>(1) to be the name of the host, a colon, and the full current working directory. A fancier
 way to do that is&gt; alias cwdcmd echo -n ^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd^G^[]1;${HOST}^GThis will put the hostname and working directory on the title bar but only the hostname in the icon manager menu.
 <p>Note that putting a cd, pushd or popd in cwdcmd may cause an infinite loop. It is the authors opinion that anyone doing so will
 get what they deserve.
 </p>jobcmd

 <br><br>Runs before each command gets executed, or when the command changes state. This is similar to postcmd, but it does not print builtins.<br><br>&gt; alias jobcmd echo -n ^[]2\;\!#:q^Gthen executing vi foo.c will put the command string in the xterm title bar.helpcommand
 Invoked by the <b>run-help</b> editor command. The command name for which help is sought is passed as sole argument. For example, if one does

 <br><br>&gt; alias helpcommand \!:1 --help
 then the help display of the command itself will be invoked, using the GNU help calling convention. Currently there is no easy way to account for various
 calling conventions (e.g., the customary Unix -h), except by using a table of many commands.periodic
 Runs every <b>tperiod</b> minutes. This provides a convenient means for checking on common but infrequent changes such as new mail. For example, if one
 does

 <br><br>&gt; set tperiod = 30
 &gt; alias periodic checknewsthen the <b>checknews</b>(1) program runs every 30 minutes. If periodic is set but <b>tperiod</b> is unset or set to 0, periodic behaves like
 precmd.precmd

 <br><br>Runs just before each prompt is printed. For example, if one does<br><br>&gt; alias precmd datethen <b><a href=date>date</a></b>(1) runs just before the shell prompts for each command. There are no limits on what precmd can be set to do, but discretion should
 be used.postcmd

 <br><br>Runs before each command gets executed.<br><br>&gt; alias postcmd echo -n ^[]2\;\!#:q^Gthen executing vi foo.c will put the command string in the xterm title bar.shell

 <br><br>Specifies the interpreter for executable scripts which do not themselves specify an interpreter. The first word should be a full path name to the desired
 interpreter (e.g., /bin/csh or /usr/local/bin/tcsh).

 <br><br><b>Special shell variables</b>
 <br><br>The shell sets <b>addsuffix</b>, <b>argv</b>, <b>autologout</b>, <b>csubstnonl</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>echo_style</b>, <b>edit</b>, <b>gid</b>,
 <b>group</b>, <b>home</b>, <b>loginsh</b>, <b>oid</b>, <b>path</b>, <b>prompt</b>, <b>prompt2</b>, <b>prompt3</b>, <b>shell</b>, <b>shlvl</b>, <b>tcsh</b>,
 <b>term</b>, <b>tty</b>, <b>uid</b>, <b>user</b> and <b>version</b> at startup; they do not change thereafter unless changed by the user. The shell updates
 <b>cwd</b>, <b>dirstack</b>, <b>owd</b> and <b>status</b> when necessary, and sets <b>logout</b> on logout.<br><br>The shell synchronizes <b>group</b>, <b>home</b>, <b>path</b>, <b>shlvl</b>, <b>term</b> and <b>user</b> with the environment variables of the same names:
 whenever the environment variable changes the shell changes the corresponding shell variable to match (unless the shell variable is read-only) and vice versa.
 Note that although <b>cwd</b> and <b>PWD</b> have identical meanings, they are not synchronized in this manner, and that the shell automatically interconverts
 the different formats of <b>path</b> and <b>PATH</b>.addsuffix (+)
 If set, filename completion adds / to the end of directories and a space to the end of normal files when they are matched exactly. Set by default.afsuser (+)
 If set, <b>autologout</b>s autolock feature uses its value instead of the local username for kerberos authentication.ampm (+)
 If set, all times are shown in 12-hour AM/PM format.argv

 <br><br>The arguments to the shell. Positional parameters are taken from <b>argv</b>, i.e., $1 is replaced by $argv[1], etc. Set by default, but usually empty
 in interactive shells.autocorrect (+)
 If set, the spell-word editor command is invoked automatically before each completion attempt.autoexpand (+)
 If set, the expand-history editor command is invoked automatically before each completion attempt. If this is set to onlyhistory, then only
 history will be expanded and a second completion will expand filenames.autolist (+)
 If set, possibilities are listed after an ambiguous completion. If set to ambiguous, possibilities are listed only when no new characters are added by
 completion.autologout (+)
 The first word is the number of minutes of inactivity before automatic logout. The optional second word is the number of minutes of inactivity before
 automatic locking. When the shell automatically logs out, it prints auto-logout, sets the variable logout to automatic and exits. When the shell
 automatically locks, the user is required to enter his password to continue working. Five incorrect attempts result in automatic logout. Set to 60 (automatic
 logout after 60 minutes, and no locking) by default in login and superuser shells, but not if the shell thinks it is running under a window system (i.e., the
 <b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable is set), the tty is a pseudo-tty (pty) or the shell was not so compiled (see the <b>version</b> shell variable). See also
 the <b>afsuser</b> and <b>logout</b> shell variables.backslash_quote (+)
 If set, backslashes (\) always quote \, , and . This may make complex quoting tasks easier, but it can cause syntax errors in <b>csh</b>(1)
 scripts.catalog

 <br><br>The file name of the message catalog. If set, tcsh use tcsh.${catalog} as a message catalog instead of default tcsh.<br><br><b>cdpath</b><br><br>A list of directories in which cd should search for subdirectories if they arent found in the current directory.<br><br><b>color</b><br><br>If set, it enables color display for the builtin <b>ls-F</b> and it passes <b>--color=auto</b> to <b>ls</b>. Alternatively, it can be set to only
 <b>ls-F</b> or only <b>ls</b> to enable color to only one command. Setting it to nothing is equivalent to setting it to <b>(ls-F ls)</b>.colorcat
 If set, it enables color escape sequence for NLS message files. And display colorful NLS messages.command (+)
 If set, the command which was passed to the shell with the <b>-c</b> flag (q.v.).compat_expr (+)
 If set, the shell will evaluate expressions right to left, like the original csh.complete (+)
 If set to enhance, completion 1) ignores case and 2) considers periods, hyphens and underscores (., - and _) to be word separators and hyphens and
 underscores to be equivalent. If set to igncase, the completion becomes case insensitive.continue (+)
 If set to a list of commands, the shell will continue the listed commands, instead of starting a new one.continue_args (+)
 Same as continue, but the shell will execute:

 <br><br>echo pwd $argv &gt; ~/.&lt;cmd&gt;_pause; %&lt;cmd&gt;

 If set to cmd, commands are automatically spelling-corrected. If set to complete, commands are automatically completed. If set to all, the entire
 command line is corrected.csubstnonl (+)
 If set, newlines and carriage returns in command substitution are replaced by spaces. Set by default.cwd

 <br><br>The full pathname of the current directory. See also the <b>dirstack</b> and <b>owd</b> shell variables.dextract (+)
 If set, pushd +n extracts the nth directory from the directory stack rather than rotating it to the top.dirsfile (+)
 The default location in which dirs -S and dirs -L look for a history file. If unset, ~/.cshdirs is used. Because only ~/.tcshrc is
 normally sourced before ~/.cshdirs, <b>dirsfile</b> should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than ~/.login.dirstack (+)
 An array of all the directories on the directory stack. $dirstack[1] is the current working directory, $dirstack[2] the first directory on the stack,
 etc. Note that the current working directory is $dirstack[1] but =0 in directory stack substitutions, etc. One can change the stack arbitrarily by setting
 <b>dirstack</b>, but the first element (the current working directory) is always correct. See also the <b>cwd</b> and <b>owd</b> shell variables.dspmbyte (+)
 Has an affect iff dspm is listed as part of the <b>version</b> shell variable. If set to euc, it enables display and editing EUC-kanji(Japanese) code.
 If set to sjis, it enables display and editing Shift-JIS(Japanese) code. If set to big5, it enables display and editing Big5(Chinese) code. If set to
 utf8, it enables display and editing Utf8(Unicode) code. If set to the following format, it enables display and editing of original multi-byte code
 format:

 <br><br>&gt; set dspmbyte = 0000....(256 bytes)....0000
 The table requires <b>just</b> 256 bytes. Each character of 256 characters corresponds (from left to right) to the ASCII codes 0x00, 0x01, ... 0xff. Each
 character is set to number 0,1,2 and 3. Each number has the following meaning:<br>
 0 ... not used for multi-byte characters.<br>
 1 ... used for the first byte of a multi-byte character.<br>
 2 ... used for the second byte of a multi-byte character.<br>
 3 ... used for both the first byte and second byte of a multi-byte character.
 <p>Example:<br>
 If set to 001322, the first character (means 0x00 of the ASCII code) and second character (means 0x01 of ASCII code) are set to 0. Then, it is not used for
 multi-byte characters. The 3rd character (0x02) is set to 1, indicating that it is used for the first byte of a multi-byte character. The 4th <b>character</b>(0x03)
 is set 3. It is used for both the first byte and the second byte of a multi-byte character. The 5th and 6th characters (0x04,0x05) are set to 2, indicating
 that they are used for the second byte of a multi-byte character.
 </p><p>The GNU fileutils version of ls cannot display multi-byte filenames without the -N ( --literal ) option. If you are using this version, set the second word
 of dspmbyte to ls. If not, for example, ls-F -l cannot display multi-byte filenames.
 </p><p>Note:<br>
 This variable can only be used if KANJI and DSPMBYTE has been defined at compile time.
 </p>dunique (+)
 If set, pushd removes any instances of name from the stack before pushing it onto the stack.echo

 <br><br>If set, each command with its arguments is echoed just before it is executed. For non-builtin commands all expansions occur before echoing. Builtin commands
 are echoed before command and filename substitution, because these substitutions are then done selectively. Set by the <b>-x</b> command line option.echo_style (+)
 The style of the echo builtin. May be set tobsd

 <p>Dont echo a newline if the first argument is -n.

 </p><p>sysv

 </p><p>Recognize backslashed escape sequences in echo strings.

 </p><p>both

 </p><p>Recognize both the -n flag and backslashed escape sequences; the default.

 </p><p>none

 </p><p>Recognize neither.
 </p>Set by default to the local system default. The BSD and System V options are described in the <b><a href=echo rel=nofollow>echo</a></b>(1) man pages on the appropriate systems.edit (+)
 If set, the command-line editor is used. Set by default in interactive shells.ellipsis (+)
 If set, the %c/%. and %C prompt sequences (see the <b>prompt</b> shell variable) indicate skipped directories with an ellipsis (...) instead of
 /&lt;skipped&gt;.fignore (+)
 Lists file name suffixes to be ignored by completion.filec

 <br><br>In tcsh, completion is always used and this variable is ignored by default. If <b>edit</b> is unset, then the traditional csh completion is
 used. If set in csh, filename completion is used.<br><br><b>gid</b> (+)<br><br>The users real group ID.group (+)
 The users group name.highlight
 If set, the incremental search match (in i-search-back and i-search-fwd) and the region between the mark and the cursor are highlighted in
 reverse video.
 <p>Highlighting requires more frequent terminal writes, which introduces extra overhead. If you care about terminal performance, you may want to leave this
 unset.
 </p>histchars
 A string value determining the characters used in <b>History substitution</b> (q.v.). The first character of its value is used as the history substitution
 character, replacing the default character !. The second character of its value replaces the character ^ in quick substitutions.histdup (+)
 Controls handling of duplicate entries in the history list. If set to all only unique history events are entered in the history list. If set to prev and
 the last history event is the same as the current command, then the current command is not entered in the history. If set to erase and the same event is
 found in the history list, that old event gets erased and the current one gets inserted. Note that the prev and all options renumber history events so
 there are no gaps.histfile (+)
 The default location in which history -S and history -L look for a history file. If unset, ~/.history is used. <b>histfile</b> is useful when
 sharing the same home directory between different machines, or when saving separate histories on different terminals. Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally
 sourced before ~/.history, <b>histfile</b> should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than ~/.login.histlit (+)
 If set, builtin and editor commands and the <b>savehist</b> mechanism use the literal (unexpanded) form of lines in the history list. See also the
 toggle-literal-history editor command.history

 <br><br>The first word indicates the number of history events to save. The optional second word (+) indicates the format in which history is printed; if not given,
 %h\t%T\t%R\n is used. The format sequences are described below under <b>prompt</b>; note the variable meaning of %R. Set to 100 by default.<br><br><b>home</b><br><br>Initialized to the home directory of the invoker. The filename expansion of ~ refers to this variable.ignoreeof
 If set to the empty string or 0 and the input device is a terminal, the end-of-file command (usually generated by the user by typing ^D on an
 empty line) causes the shell to print Use exit to leave tcsh. instead of exiting. This prevents the shell from accidentally being killed. Historically this
 setting exited after 26 successive EOFs to avoid infinite loops. If set to a number n, the shell ignores n - 1 consecutive end-of-files
 and exits on the nth. (+) If unset, 1 is used, i.e., the shell exits on a single ^D.implicitcd (+)
 If set, the shell treats a directory name typed as a command as though it were a request to change to that directory. If set to verbose, the change
 of directory is echoed to the standard output. This behavior is inhibited in non-interactive shell scripts, or for command strings with more than one word.
 Changing directory takes precedence over executing a like-named command, but it is done after alias substitutions. Tilde and variable expansions work as
 expected.inputmode (+)
 If set to insert or overwrite, puts the editor into that input mode at the beginning of each line.killdup (+)
 Controls handling of duplicate entries in the kill ring. If set to all only unique strings are entered in the kill ring. If set to prev and the last
 killed string is the same as the current killed string, then the current string is not entered in the ring. If set to erase and the same string is found in
 the kill ring, the old string is erased and the current one is inserted.killring (+)
 Indicates the number of killed strings to keep in memory. Set to 30 by default. If unset or set to less than 2, the shell will only keep the most
 recently killed string. Strings are put in the killring by the editor commands that delete (kill) strings of text, e.g. backward-delete-word,
 kill-line, etc, as well as the copy-region-as-kill command. The yank editor command will yank the most recently killed string into the
 command-line, while yank-pop (see <b>Editor commands</b>) can be used to yank earlier killed strings.listflags (+)
 If set to x, a or A, or any combination thereof (e.g., xA), they are used as flags to ls-F, making it act like ls -xF, ls -Fa, ls -FA
 or a combination (e.g., ls -FxA): a shows all files (even if they start with a .), A shows all files but . and .., and x sorts across instead of
 down. If the second word of <b>listflags</b> is set, it is used as the path to <b><a href=ls>ls</a></b>(1).listjobs (+)
 If set, all jobs are listed when a job is suspended. If set to long, the listing is in long format.listlinks (+)
 If set, the ls-F builtin command shows the type of file to which each symbolic link points.listmax (+)
 The maximum number of items which the list-choices editor command will list without asking first.listmaxrows (+)
 The maximum number of rows of items which the list-choices editor command will list without asking first.loginsh (+)
 Set by the shell if it is a login shell. Setting or unsetting it within a shell has no effect. See also <b>shlvl</b>.logout (+)
 Set by the shell to normal before a normal logout, automatic before an automatic logout, and hangup if the shell was killed by a hangup signal (see
 <b>Signal handling</b>). See also the <b>autologout</b> shell variable.mail

 <br><br>The names of the files or directories to check for incoming mail, separated by whitespace, and optionally preceded by a numeric word. Before each prompt, if
 10 minutes have passed since the last check, the shell checks each file and says You have new mail. (or, if <b>mail</b> contains multiple files, You have
 new mail in name.) if the filesize is greater than zero in size and has a modification time greater than its access time.If you are in a login shell, then no mail file is reported unless it has been modified after the time the shell has started up, to prevent redundant
 notifications. Most login programs will tell you whether or not you have mail when you log in.
 <p>If a file specified in <b>mail</b> is a directory, the shell will count each file within that directory as a separate message, and will report You have
 n mails. or You have n mails in name. as appropriate. This functionality is provided primarily for those systems which store mail in
 this manner, such as the Andrew Mail System.
 </p><p>If the first word of <b>mail</b> is numeric it is taken as a different mail checking interval, in seconds.
 </p><p>Under very rare circumstances, the shell may report You have mail. instead of You have new mail.
 </p>matchbeep (+)
 If set to never, completion never beeps. If set to nomatch, it beeps only when there is no match. If set to ambiguous, it beeps when there are
 multiple matches. If set to notunique, it beeps when there is one exact and other longer matches. If unset, ambiguous is used.nobeep (+)
 If set, beeping is completely disabled. See also <b>visiblebell</b>.noclobber
 If set, restrictions are placed on output redirection to insure that files are not accidentally destroyed and that &gt;&gt; redirections refer to existing
 files, as described in the <b>Input/output</b> section.noding

 <br><br>If set, disable the printing of DING! in the <b>prompt</b> time specifiers at the change of hour.<br><br><b>noglob</b><br><br>If set, <b>Filename substitution</b> and <b>Directory stack substitution</b> (q.v.) are inhibited. This is most useful in shell scripts which do not deal
 with filenames, or after a list of filenames has been obtained and further expansions are not desirable.nokanji (+)
 If set and the shell supports Kanji (see the <b>version</b> shell variable), it is disabled so that the meta key can be used.nonomatch
 If set, a <b>Filename substitution</b> or <b>Directory stack substitution</b> (q.v.) which does not match any existing files is left untouched rather than
 causing an error. It is still an error for the substitution to be malformed, e.g., echo [ still gives an error.nostat (+)
 A list of directories (or glob-patterns which match directories; see <b>Filename substitution</b>) that should not be <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2)ed during a completion
 operation. This is usually used to exclude directories which take too much time to <b><a href=/man/2/stat rel=nofollow>stat</a></b>(2), for example /afs.notify

 <br><br>If set, the shell announces job completions asynchronously. The default is to present job completions just before printing a prompt.<br><br><b>oid</b> (+)<br><br>The users real organization ID. (Domain/OS only)<br><br><b>owd</b> (+)<br><br>The old working directory, equivalent to the - used by cd and pushd. See also the <b>cwd</b> and <b>dirstack</b> shell variables.<br><br><b>padhour</b><br><br>If set, enable the printing of padding 0 for hours, in 24 and 12 hour formats. E.G.: 07:45:42 vs. 7:45:42<br><br><b>path</b><br><br>A list of directories in which to look for executable commands. A null word specifies the current directory. If there is no <b>path</b> variable then only
 full path names will execute. <b>path</b> is set by the shell at startup from the <b>PATH</b> environment variable or, if <b>PATH</b> does not exist, to a
 system-dependent default something like (/usr/local/bin /usr/bsd /bin /usr/bin .). The shell may put . first or last in <b>path</b> or omit it entirely
 depending on how it was compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable. A shell which is given neither the <b>-c</b> nor the <b>-t</b> option hashes the
 contents of the directories in <b>path</b> after reading ~/.tcshrc and each time <b>path</b> is reset. If one adds a new command to a directory in
 <b>path</b> while the shell is active, one may need to do a rehash for the shell to find it.printexitvalue (+)
 If set and an interactive program exits with a non-zero status, the shell prints Exit <b>status</b>.prompt

 <br><br>The string which is printed before reading each command from the terminal. <b>prompt</b> may include any of the following formatting sequences (+), which
 are replaced by the given information:%/

 <p>The current working directory.

 </p><p>%~

 </p><p>The current working directory, but with ones home directory represented by ~ and other users home directories represented by ~user as per <b>Filename
 substitution</b>. ~user substitution happens only if the shell has already used ~user in a pathname in the current session.
 </p>%c[[0]n], %.[[0]n]The trailing component of the current working directory, or n trailing components if a digit n is given. If n begins with 0, the
 number of skipped components precede the trailing <b>component</b>(s) in the format /&lt;skipped&gt;trailing. If the <b>ellipsis</b> shell variable is set,
 skipped components are represented by an ellipsis so the whole becomes ...trailing. ~ substitution is done as in %~ above, but the ~ component is
 ignored when counting trailing components.%C

 <p>Like %c, but without ~ substitution.
 </p>%h, %!, !The current history event number.%M

 <p>The full hostname.

 </p><p>%m

 </p><p>The hostname up to the first ..
 </p>%S (%s)Start (stop) standout mode.%B (%b)Start (stop) boldfacing mode.%U (%u)Start (stop) underline mode.%t, %@The time of day in 12-hour AM/PM format.%T

 <p>Like %t, but in 24-hour format (but see the <b>ampm</b> shell variable).

 </p><p>%p

 </p><p>The precise time of day in 12-hour AM/PM format, with seconds.

 </p><p>%P

 </p><p>Like %p, but in 24-hour format (but see the <b>ampm</b> shell variable).

 </p><p>The month in Mon format.

 </p><p>%W

 </p><p>The month in mm format.

 </p><p>%y

 </p><p>The year in yy format.

 </p><p>%Y

 </p><p>%l

 </p><p>The shells tty.

 </p><p>%L

 </p><p>Clears from the end of the prompt to end of the display or the end of the line.

 </p><p>%$

 </p><p>Expands the shell or environment variable name immediately after the $.

 </p><p>%#

 </p><p>&gt; (or the first character of the <b>promptchars</b> shell variable) for normal users, # (or the second character of <b>promptchars</b>) for the
 superuser.
 </p>%{string%}Includes string as a literal escape sequence. It should be used only to change terminal attributes and should not move the cursor location. This
 cannot be the last sequence in <b>prompt</b>.%?

 <p>The return code of the command executed just before the prompt.

 </p><p>%R

 </p><p>In <b>prompt2</b>, the status of the parser. In <b>prompt3</b>, the corrected string. In <b>history</b>, the history string.
 </p>%B, %S, %U and %{string%} are available in only eight-bit-clean shells; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.
 <p>The bold, standout and underline sequences are often used to distinguish a superuser shell. For example,
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; set prompt = %m [%h] %B[%@]%b [%/] you rang?
 tut [37] <b>[2:54pm]</b> [/usr/accts/sys] you rang? _If %t, %@, %T, %p, or %P is used, and <b>noding</b> is not set, then print DING! on the change of hour (i.e, :00 minutes) instead of the
 actual time.
 <p>Set by default to %#  in interactive shells.
 </p>prompt2 (+)
 The string with which to prompt in while and foreach loops and after lines ending in \. The same format sequences may be used as in
 <b>prompt</b> (q.v.); note the variable meaning of %R. Set by default to %R?  in interactive shells.prompt3 (+)
 The string with which to prompt when confirming automatic spelling correction. The same format sequences may be used as in <b>prompt</b> (q.v.); note the
 variable meaning of %R. Set by default to CORRECT&gt;%R (y|n|e|a)?  in interactive shells.promptchars (+)
 If set (to a two-character string), the %# formatting sequence in the <b>prompt</b> shell variable is replaced with the first character for normal users
 and the second character for the superuser.pushdtohome (+)
 If set, pushd without arguments does pushd ~, like cd.pushdsilent (+)
 If set, pushd and popd do not print the directory stack.recexact (+)
 If set, completion completes on an exact match even if a longer match is possible.recognize_only_executables (+)
 If set, command listing displays only files in the path that are executable. Slow.rmstar (+)
 If set, the user is prompted before rm * is executed.rprompt (+)
 The string to print on the right-hand side of the screen (after the command input) when the prompt is being displayed on the left. It recognizes the same
 formatting characters as <b>prompt</b>. It will automatically disappear and reappear as necessary, to ensure that command input isnt obscured, and will appear
 only if the prompt, command input, and itself will fit together on the first line. If <b>edit</b> isnt set, then <b>rprompt</b> will be printed after the
 prompt and before the command input.savedirs (+)
 If set, the shell does dirs -S before exiting. If the first word is set to a number, at most that many directory stack entries are saved.savehist
 If set, the shell does history -S before exiting. If the first word is set to a number, at most that many lines are saved. (The number must be less than
 or equal to <b>history</b>.) If the second word is set to merge, the history list is merged with the existing history file instead of replacing it (if there
 is one) and sorted by time stamp and the most recent events are retained. (+)sched (+)
 The format in which the sched builtin command prints scheduled events; if not given, %h\t%T\t%R\n is used. The format sequences are described above
 under <b>prompt</b>; note the variable meaning of %R.shell

 <br><br>The file in which the shell resides. This is used in forking shells to interpret files which have execute bits set, but which are not executable by the
 system. (See the description of <b>Builtin and non-builtin command execution</b>.) Initialized to the (system-dependent) home of the shell.shlvl (+)
 The number of nested shells. Reset to 1 in login shells. See also <b>loginsh</b>.status

 <br><br>The status of any error in a pipeline or a backquote expansion that is propagated as a result status, unless tcsh_posix_status variable is set, and only
 the last command status is taken in account (the latter is default behaviour in POSIX-like shells). If it terminated abnormally, then 0200 is added to the
 status. Builtin commands which fail return exit status 1, all other builtin commands return status 0.symlinks (+)
 Can be set to several different values to control symbolic link (symlink) resolution:If set to chase, whenever the current directory changes to a directory containing a symbolic link, it is expanded to the real name of the directory to
 which the link points. This does not work for the users home directory; this is a bug.
 <p>If set to ignore, the shell tries to construct a current directory relative to the current directory before the link was crossed. This means that
 cding through a symbolic link and then cd ..ing returns one to the original directory. This affects only builtin commands and filename completion.

 </p><p>If set to expand, the shell tries to fix symbolic links by actually expanding arguments which look like path names. This affects any command, not just
 builtins. Unfortunately, this does not work for hard-to-recognize filenames, such as those embedded in command options. Expansion may be prevented by quoting.
 While this setting is usually the most convenient, it is sometimes misleading and sometimes confusing when it fails to recognize an argument which should be
 expanded. A compromise is to use ignore and use the editor command normalize-path (bound by default to ^X-n) when necessary.
 </p><p>Some examples are in order. First, lets set up some play directories:
 </p>

 <br><br>&gt; cd /tmp
 &gt; mkdir from from/src to<br>
 &gt; ln -s from/src to/dstHeres the behavior with <b>symlinks</b> unset,

 <br><br>&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
 /tmp/to/dst<br>
 &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd<br>
 /tmp/fromheres the behavior with <b>symlinks</b> set to chase,

 <br><br>&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
 /tmp/from/src<br>
 &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd<br>
 /tmp/fromheres the behavior with <b>symlinks</b> set to ignore,

 <br><br>&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
 /tmp/to/dst<br>
 &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd<br>
 /tmp/toand heres the behavior with <b>symlinks</b> set to expand.

 <br><br>&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
 /tmp/to/dst<br>
 &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd<br>
 /tmp/to<br>
 &gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd<br>
 /tmp/to/dst<br>
 &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd<br>
 /tmp/from<br>
 &gt; /bin/echo ..<br>
 /tmp/to<br>
 &gt; /bin/echo ..<br>
 ..Note that expand expansion 1) works just like ignore for builtins like cd, 2) is prevented by quoting, and 3) happens before filenames are passed
 to non-builtin commands.tcsh (+)
 The version number of the shell in the format R.VV.PP, where R is the major release number, VV the current version and PP the patchlevel.term

 <br><br>The terminal type. Usually set in ~/.login as described under <b>Startup and shutdown</b>.<br><br><b>time</b><br><br>If set to a number, then the time builtin (q.v.) executes automatically after each command which takes more than that many CPU seconds. If there is a
 second word, it is used as a format string for the output of the time builtin. (u) The following sequences may be used in the format string:%U

 <p>The time the process spent in user mode in cpu seconds.

 </p><p>%S

 If set, a screen flash is used rather than the audible bell. See also <b>nobeep</b>.watch (+)
 A list of user/terminal pairs to watch for logins and logouts. If either the user is any all terminals are watched for the given user and vice versa.
 Setting <b>watch</b> to (any any) watches all users and terminals. For example,

 <br><br>set watch = (george ttyd1 any console $user any)
 reports activity of the user george on ttyd1, any user on the console, and oneself (or a trespasser) on any terminal.
 <p>Logins and logouts are checked every 10 minutes by default, but the first word of <b>watch</b> can be set to a number to check every so many minutes. For
 example,
 </p>

 <br><br>set watch = (1 any any)
 reports any login/logout once every minute. For the impatient, the log builtin command triggers a <b>watch</b> report at any time. All current logins
 are reported (as with the log builtin) when <b>watch</b> is first set.
 <p>The <b>who</b> shell variable controls the format of <b>watch</b> reports.
 </p>who (+)

 <br><br>The format string for <b>watch</b> messages. The following sequences are replaced by the given information:%n

 <p>The name of the user who logged in/out.

 </p><p>%a

 </p><p>The observed action, i.e., logged on, logged off or replaced olduser on.

 </p><p>%l

 </p><p>The terminal (tty) on which the user logged in/out.

 </p><p>%M

 </p><p>The full hostname of the remote host, or local if the login/logout was from the local host.

 </p><p>%m

 </p><p>The hostname of the remote host up to the first .. The full name is printed if it is an IP address or an X Window System display.
 </p>%M and %m are available on only systems that store the remote hostname in /etc/utmp. If unset, %n has %a %l from %m. is used, or %n has %a %l. on
 systems which dont store the remote hostname.wordchars (+)
 A list of non-alphanumeric characters to be considered part of a word by the forward-word, backward-word etc., editor commands. If unset,
 *?_-.[]~= is used.

 Equivalent to the <b>afsuser</b> shell variable.COLUMNS

 <br><br>The number of columns in the terminal. See <b>Terminal management</b>.<br><br><b>DISPLAY</b><br><br>Used by X Window System (see <b>X</b>(1)). If set, the shell does not set <b>autologout</b> (q.v.).<br><br><b>EDITOR</b><br><br>The pathname to a default editor.

 Initialized to the name of the machine on which the shell is running, as determined by the <b><a href=/man/2/gethostname>gethostname</a></b>(2) system call.HOSTTYPE (+)
 Initialized to the type of machine on which the shell is running, as determined at compile time. This variable is obsolete and will be removed in a future
 version.HPATH (+)
 A colon-separated list of directories in which the run-help editor command looks for command documentation.LANG

 <br><br>Gives the preferred character environment. See <b>Native Language System support</b>.LC_CTYPE
 If set, only ctype character handling is changed. See <b>Native Language System support</b>.LINES

 <br><br>The number of lines in the terminal. See <b>Terminal management</b>.LS_COLORS
 The format of this variable is reminiscent of the <b><b><a href=/man/5/termcap rel=nofollow>termcap</a></b>(5)</b> file format; a colon-separated list of expressions of the form xx=string, where
 xx is a two-character variable name. The variables with their associated defaults are:no

 </p>Left coderc

 <p>m
 </p>Right codeec

 <p>(none)
 </p>End code (replaces lc+no+rc)You need to include only the variables you want to change from the default.
 <p>File names can also be colorized based on filename extension. This is specified in the <b>LS_COLORS</b> variable using the syntax <b>*ext=string</b>. For
 example, using ISO 6429 codes, to color all C-language source files blue you would specify <b>*.c=34</b>. This would color all files ending in <b>.c</b> in
 blue (34) color.
 </p><p>Control characters can be written either in C-style-escaped notation, or in stty-like ^-notation. The C-style notation adds <b>^[</b> for Escape, <b>_</b>
 for a normal space character, and <b>?</b> for Delete. In addition, the <b>^[</b> escape character can be used to override the default interpretation of
 <b>^[</b>, <b>^</b>, <b>:</b> and <b>=</b>.
 </p><p>Each file will be written as <b>&lt;lc&gt; &lt;color-code&gt; &lt;rc&gt; &lt;filename&gt; &lt;ec&gt;</b>. If the <b>&lt;ec&gt;</b> code is undefined, the
 sequence <b>&lt;lc&gt; &lt;no&gt; &lt;rc&gt;</b> will be used instead. This is generally more convenient to use, but less general. The left, right and end
 codes are provided so you dont have to type common parts over and over again and to support weird terminals; you will generally not need to change them at all
 unless your terminal does not use ISO 6429 color sequences but a different system.
 </p><p>If your terminal does use ISO 6429 color codes, you can compose the type codes (i.e., all except the <b>lc</b>, <b>rc</b>, and <b>ec</b> codes) from
 numerical commands separated by semicolons. The most common commands are:
 </p>

 <br><br>0<br><br>to restore default color<br><br>1<br><br>for brighter colors<br><br>4<br><br>for underlined text<br><br>5<br><br>for flashing text<br><br>30<br><br>for black foreground<br><br>31<br><br>for red foreground<br><br>32<br><br>for green foreground<br><br>33<br><br>for yellow (or brown) foreground<br><br>34<br><br>for blue foreground<br><br>35<br><br>for purple foreground<br><br>36<br><br>for cyan foreground<br><br>37<br><br>for white (or gray) foreground<br><br>40<br><br>for black background<br><br>41<br><br>for red background<br><br>42<br><br>for green background<br><br>43<br><br>for yellow (or brown) background<br><br>44<br><br>for blue background<br><br>45<br><br>for purple background<br><br>46<br><br>for cyan background<br><br>47<br><br>for white (or gray) background
 Not all commands will work on all systems or display devices.
 <p>A few terminal programs do not recognize the default end code properly. If all text gets colorized after you do a directory listing, try changing the
 <b>no</b> and <b>fi</b> codes from 0 to the numerical codes for your standard fore- and background colors.
 </p>MACHTYPE (+)
 The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model), as determined at compile time.NOREBIND (+)
 If set, printable characters are not rebound to self-insert-command. See <b>Native Language System support</b>.OSTYPE (+)
 The operating system, as determined at compile time.PATH

 <br><br>A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for executables.

 <br><br>When a suspended command is restarted, the shell prints the directory it started in if this is different from the current directory. This can be misleading
 (i.e., wrong) as the job may have changed directories internally.<br><br>Shell builtin functions are not stoppable/restartable. Command sequences of the form a ; b ; c are also not handled gracefully when stopping is attempted.
 If you suspend b, the shell will then immediately execute c. This is especially noticeable if this expansion results from an alias. It suffices to
 place the sequence of commands in ()s to force it to a subshell, i.e., ( a ; b ; c ).<br><br>Control over tty output after processes are started is primitive; perhaps this will inspire someone to work on a good virtual terminal interface. In a
 virtual terminal interface much more interesting things could be done with output control.<br><br>Alias substitution is most often used to clumsily simulate shell procedures; shell procedures should be provided rather than aliases.<br><br>Commands within loops are not placed in the history list.

 allow control commands to be placed anywhere, to be combined with |, and to be used with &amp; and ; metasyntax.<br><br>foreach doesnt ignore here documents when looking for its end.<br><br>It should be possible to use the : modifiers on the output of command substitutions.<br><br>The screen update for lines longer than the screen width is very poor if the terminal cannot move the cursor up (i.e., terminal type dumb).<br><br><b>HPATH</b> and <b>NOREBIND</b> dont need to be environment variables.<br><br>Glob-patterns which do not use ?, * or [] or which use {} or ~ are not negated correctly.<br><br>The single-command form of if does output redirection even if the expression is false and the command is not executed.<br><br>ls-F includes file identification characters when sorting filenames and does not handle control characters in filenames well.

 Allow erasing of installed packages to resolve dependencies. This option could be used as an alternative to yum swap command where packages to remove are not explicitly defined.
 Automatically answer no for all questions
 Try the best available package versions in transactions. Specifically during <a class=reference internal href=#upgrade-command-label>dnf upgrade</a>, which by default skips over updates that can not be installed for dependency reasons, the switch forces DNF to only consider the latest packages. When running into packages with broken dependencies, DNF will fail giving a reason why the latest version can not be installed.
 Includes packages that fix a bugfix issue. Applicable for upgrade command.
 Includes packages that fix a Bugzilla ID, Eg. 123123. Applicable for upgrade
 command.
 <p class=first>Run entirely from system cache, don’t update the cache and use it even in case it is expired.</p>
 <p class=last>DNF uses a separate cache for each user under which it executes. The cache for the root user is called the system cache. This switch allows a regular user read-only access to the system cache which usually is more fresh than the user’s and thus he does not have to wait for metadata sync.</p>

 Auto Remove Command¶
 <br><br>dnf [options] autoremove
 <br><br>Packages listed in <a class=reference internal href=conf_ref.html#installonlypkgs-label>installonlypkgs</a> are never automatically removed by
 this command.
 <br><br>dnf [options] autoremove &lt;spec&gt;...
 <br><br>This is alias for <a class=reference internal href=#remove-command-label>Remove Command</a> command with clean_requirements_on_remove set to
 True. It removes the specified packages from the system along with any packages depending on the
 packages being removed. Each &lt;spec&gt; can be either a &lt;package-spec&gt;, which specifies a
 package directly, or a @&lt;group-spec&gt;, which specifies an (environment) group which contains
 it. It also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.
 <br><br>There are also a few specific autoremove commands autoremove-n, autoremove-na and
 autoremove-nevra that allow to specify exact argument forms.
 <br><br>This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also <a class=reference internal href=#metadata-synchronization-label>Metadata Synchronization</a>.
 Check Command¶
 <br><br>dnf [options] check [--dependencies] [--duplicates] [--obsoleted] [--provides]
 Check Update Command¶
 <br><br>dnf [options] check-update [&lt;package-specs&gt;...]
 <br><br>Non-interactively checks if updates of the specified packages are available. If no &lt;package-specs&gt; are given checks whether any updates at all are available for your system. DNF exit code will be 100 when there are updates available and a list of the updates will be printed, 0 if not and 1 if an error occurs.
 <br><br>Please note that having a specific newer version available for an installed package (and reported by check-update) does not imply that subsequent dnf upgrade will install it. The difference is that dnf upgrade must also ensure the satisfiability of all dependencies and other restrictions.
 Clean Command¶
 <br><br>Performs cleanup of temporary files kept for repositories. This includes any
 such data left behind from disabled or removed repositories as well as for
 different distribution release versions.
 Removes cache files generated from the repository metadata. This forces DNF
 to regenerate the cache files the next time it is run.
 Marks the repository metadata expired. DNF will re-validate the cache for
 each repo the next time it is used.
 Removes repository metadata. Those are the files which DNF uses to determine
 the remote availability of packages. Using this option will make DNF
 download all the metadata the next time it is run.
 Removes any cached packages from the system.
 Does all of the above.
 Distro-sync command¶
 <p class=first>As necessary upgrades, downgrades or keeps selected installed packages to match
 the latest version available from any enabled repository. If no package is given, all installed packages are considered.</p>
 <p class=last>See also <a class=reference internal href=#configuration-files-replacement-policy-label>Configuration Files Replacement Policy</a>.</p>
 ¶
 Deprecated alias for the <a class=reference internal href=#distro-sync-command-label>Distro-sync command</a>.
 Downgrade Command¶
 Downgrades the specified packages to the highest of all known lower versions if possible. When version is given and is lower than version of installed package then it downgrades to target version.
 Erase Command¶
 Deprecated alias for the <a class=reference internal href=#remove-command-label>Remove Command</a>.
 Group Command¶
 <br><br>Groups are virtual collections of packages. DNF keeps track of groups that the user selected (“marked”) installed and can manipulate the comprising packages with simple commands.
 Display overview of how many groups are installed and available. With a
 spec, limit the output to the matching groups. summary is the default
 groups subcommand.
 Display package lists of a group. Shows which packages are installed or
 available from a repo when -v is used.
 Mark the specified group installed and install packages it contains. Also include optional packages of the group if --with-optional is specified. All mandatory packages are going to be installed otherwise the transaction fails. Default packages will be installed whenever possible. Optional and default packages that are in conflict with other packages or have missing dependencies does not terminate the transaction and will be skipped.
 List all matching groups, either among installed or available groups. If
 nothing is specified list all known groups. Options installed and available narrows down the requested list.
 Records are ordered by display_order tag defined in comps.xml file.
 Provides more detailed information when -v option is used.
 Mark the group removed and remove those packages in the group from the system which are neither comprising another installed group and were not installed explicitly by the user.
 Upgrades the packages from the group and upgrades the group itself. The latter comprises of installing pacakges that were added to the group by the distribution and removing packages that got removed from the group as far as they were not installed explicitly by the user.
 <br><br>Groups can also be marked installed or removed without physically manipulating any packages:
 Mark the specified group installed. No packages will be installed by this command but the group is then considered installed.
 Mark the specified group removed. No packages will be removed by this command.
 <br><br>See also <a class=reference internal href=#configuration-files-replacement-policy-label>Configuration Files Replacement Policy</a>.
 Help Command¶
 Displays the help text for all commands. If given a command name then only
 displays the help for that particular command.
 History Command¶
 <br><br>The history command allows the user to view what has happened in past
 transactions and act according to this information (assuming the
 history_record configuration option is set).
 The default history action is listing information about given transactions
 in a table. Each &lt;spec&gt; can be either a &lt;transaction-spec&gt;, which
 specifies a transaction directly, or a &lt;transaction-spec&gt;..&lt;transaction-spec&gt;,
 which specifies a range of transactions, or a &lt;package-name-spec&gt;,
 which specifies a transaction by a package which it manipulated. When no
 transaction is specified, list all known transactions.
 Describe the given transactions. The meaning of &lt;spec&gt; is the same as
 in the <a class=reference internal href=#history-list-command-label>History List Command</a>. When no
 transaction is specified, describe what happened during the latest
 transaction.
 Repeat the specified transaction. If it is not possible to redo any
 operation due to the current state of RPMDB, do not redo any operation.
 Undo all transactions performed after the specified transaction. If it is
 not possible to undo any transaction due to the current state of RPMDB,
 do not undo any transaction.
 Perform the opposite operation to all operations performed in the
 specified transaction. If it is not possible to undo any operation due to
 the current state of RPMDB, do not undo any operation.
 List names of all packages installed by a user. The output can be used as
 the %packages section in a <a class=reference external href=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart>kickstart</a> file. It will show all installonly packages, packages installed outside of DNF and packages not installed as dependency. I.e. it lists packages that will stay on the system when <a class=reference internal href=#autoremove-command-label>Auto Remove Command</a> or <a class=reference internal href=#remove-command-label>Remove Command</a> along with clean_requirements_on_remove configuration option set to True is executed.
 <br><br>This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata.
 See also <a class=reference internal href=#metadata-synchronization-label>Metadata Synchronization</a>
 and <a class=reference internal href=#configuration-files-replacement-policy-label>Configuration Files Replacement Policy</a>.
 Info Command¶
 Is used to list description and summary information about installed and available packages.
 <br><br>This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also <a class=reference internal href=#metadata-synchronization-label>Metadata Synchronization</a>.
 Install Command¶
 <p class=first>DNF makes sure that the given packages and their dependencies are installed
 on the system. Each &lt;spec&gt; can be either a <a class=reference internal href=#specifying-packages-label>&lt;package-spec&gt;</a>, or a @<a class=reference internal href=#specifying-groups-label>&lt;group-spec&gt;</a>. See <a class=reference internal href=#install-examples-label>Install Examples</a>.
 If a given package or provide cannot be (and is not already) installed,
 the exit code will be non-zero.</p>
 <p>When <a class=reference internal href=#specifying-packages-label>&lt;package-spec&gt;</a> that specify exact version
 of the package is given, DNF will install the desired version, no matter which
 version of the package is already installed. The former version of the package
 will be removed in the case of non-installonly package.</p>
 <p>There are also a few specific install commands install-n, install-na and
 install-nevra that allow to specify exact argument forms.</p>
 <p class=last>See also <a class=reference internal href=#configuration-files-replacement-policy-label>Configuration Files Replacement Policy</a>.</p>
 Install Examples¶
 Install package tito (tito is package name).
 Install local rpm file tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm from ~/Downloads/
 directory.
 Install package with specific version. If the package is already installed it
 will automatically try to downgrade or upgrade to specific version.
 Install the latest available version of package. If the package is already installed it
 will automatically try to upgrade to the latest version. If the latest version
 of package cannot be installed, the installation fail.
 DNF will automatically recognize that vim is not a package name, but
 provide, and install a package that provides vim with all required
 dependencies. Note: Package name match has precedence over package provides
 match.
 Install package directly from URL.
 Install environmental group ‘Web Server’
 Install a package that provides /usr/bin/rpmsign file.
 List Command¶
 <br><br>Dumps lists of packages depending on the packages’ relation to the
 system. A package is installed if it is present in the RPMDB, and it is available
 if it is not installed but it is present in a repository that DNF knows about.
 The list command can also limit the displayed packages according to other criteria,
 e.g. to only those that update an installed package. The <a class=reference internal href=conf_ref.html#exclude-label>exclude</a> option in configuration file (.conf) might influence the
 result, but if the command line option -<a class=reference internal href=#disableexcludes-label>-disableexcludes</a> is used, it ensure that all installed packages will be
 listed.
 <br><br>All the forms take a [&lt;package-specs&gt;...] parameter to further limit the
 result to only those packages matching it.
 Lists all packages known to us, present in the RPMDB, in a repo or in both.
 Lists installed packages.
 Lists available packages.
 Lists extras, that is packages installed on the system that are not
 available in any known repository.
 List the packages installed on the system that are obsoleted by packages in
 any known repository.
 List packages recently added into the repositories.
 List upgrades available for the installed packages.
 List packages which will be removed by dnf autoremove command.
 <br><br>This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also <a class=reference internal href=#metadata-synchronization-label>Metadata Synchronization</a>.
 Makecache Command¶
 Downloads and caches in binary format metadata for all known repos. Tries to
 avoid downloading whenever possible (e.g. when the local metadata hasn’t
 expired yet or when the metadata timestamp hasn’t changed).
 Like plain makecache but instructs DNF to be more resource-aware,
 meaning will not do anything if running on battery power and will terminate
 immediately if it’s too soon after the last successful makecache run
 (see dnf.conf(5), <a class=reference internal href=conf_ref.html#metadata-timer-sync-label>metadata_timer_sync</a>).
 Mark Command¶
 Marks the specified packages as installed by user. This can be useful if any package was installed as a dependency and is desired to stay on the system when <a class=reference internal href=#autoremove-command-label>Auto Remove Command</a> or <a class=reference internal href=#remove-command-label>Remove Command</a> along with clean_requirements_on_remove configuration option set to True is executed.
 Unmarks the specified packages as installed by user. Whenever you as a user don’t need a specific package you can mark it for removal. The package stays installed on the system but will be removed when <a class=reference internal href=#autoremove-command-label>Auto Remove Command</a> or <a class=reference internal href=#remove-command-label>Remove Command</a> along with clean_requirements_on_remove configuration option set to True is executed. You should use this operation instead of <a class=reference internal href=#remove-command-label>Remove Command</a> if you’re not sure whether the package is a requirement of other user installed packages on the system.
 Provides Command¶
 Finds the packages providing the given &lt;provide-spec&gt;. This is useful
 when one knows a filename and wants to find what package (installed or not)
 provides this file.
 <br><br>This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also <a class=reference internal href=#metadata-synchronization-label>Metadata Synchronization</a>.
 Reinstall Command¶
 Installs the specified packages, fails if some of the packages are either
 not installed or not available (i.e. there is no repository where to
 download the same RPM).
 Remove Command¶
 Removes the specified packages from the system along with any packages depending on the packages being removed. Each &lt;spec&gt; can be either a &lt;package-spec&gt;, which specifies a package directly, or a @&lt;group-spec&gt;, which specifies an (environment) group which contains it. If clean_requirements_on_remove is enabled (the default) also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.
 Removes older version of duplicated packages.
 <p class=first>Removes old installonly packages keeping only installonly_limit latest versions.</p>
 <p class=last>There are also a few specific remove commands remove-n, remove-na and remove-nevra
 that allow to specify exact argument forms.</p>
 Repoinfo Command¶
 repolist command
 that provides more detailed information like Repolist Command¶
 Depending on the exact command, lists enabled, disabled or all known
 repositories. Lists all enabled repositories by default. Provides more
 detailed information when -v option is used.
 <br><br>This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also <a class=reference internal href=#metadata-synchronization-label>Metadata Synchronization</a>.
 Repoquery Command¶
 Searches the available DNF repositories for selected packages and displays the requested information about them. It
 is an equivalent of rpm -q for remote repositories.
 Provides list of recognized tags by repoquery option -<a class=reference internal href=#queryformat-repoquery-label>-queryformat</a>
 ¶
 <br><br>Together with &lt;pkg-spec&gt;, control what packages are displayed in the output. If &lt;pkg-spec&gt; is given, the set of
 resulting packages matching the specification. All packages are considered if no &lt;pkg-spec&gt; is specified.
 Package specification like: name[-[epoch:]version[-release]][.arch]. See <a class=reference internal href=#specifying-packages-label>Specifying Packages</a>
 Limit the resulting set only to packages of selected architectures.
 Limit the resulting set to installed duplicated packages (i.e. more package versions
 for the same name and architecture). Installonly packages are excluded from this set.
 Limit the resulting set to leaves packages that were installed as dependencies so they are no longer needed. This
 switch lists packages that are going to be removed after executing dnf autoremove command.
 Limit the resulting set to available packages only (set by default).
 Limit the resulting set to packages that are not present in any of available repositories.
 Limit the resulting set only to package that owns &lt;file&gt;.
 Limit the resulting set to installed packages. The <a class=reference internal href=conf_ref.html#exclude-label>exclude</a> option in configuration file
 (.conf) might influence the result, but if the command line option  -<a class=reference internal href=#disableexcludes-label>-disableexcludes</a> is used, it ensures that all installed packages will be listed.
 Limit the resulting set to installed installonly packages.
 Limit the resulting set to &lt;number&gt; of latest packages for every package name and architecture.
 If &lt;number&gt; is negative skip &lt;number&gt; of latest packages.
 Limit the resulting set to packages that were recently edited.
 Limit the resulting set only to packages from repo identified by &lt;repoid&gt;.
 Can be used multiple times with accumulative effect.
 Report unsatisfied dependencies among installed packages (i.e. missing requires and
 and existing conflicts).
 Limit the resulting set to packages that provide an upgrade for some already installed package.
 Limit the resulting set only to packages that enhance &lt;capability&gt;.
 Limit the resulting set only to packages that provide &lt;capability&gt;.
 Limit the resulting set only to packages that recommend &lt;capability&gt;.
 Limit the resulting set only to packages that require &lt;capability&gt;.
 Limit the resulting set only to packages that suggest &lt;capability&gt;.
 Limit the resulting set only to packages that supplement &lt;capability&gt;.
 This option is stackable with --whatrequires only. Additionally it adds to the result set all packages requiring
 the package features (used as default).
 This option is stackable with --whatrequires only. Limit the resulting set only to packages that require
 &lt;capability&gt; specified by –whatrequires.
 Operate on corresponding source RPM.
 ¶
 <br><br>Set what information is displayed about each package.
 <br><br>The following are mutually exclusive, i.e. at most one can be specified. If no query option is given, matching packages
 are displayed in the standard NEVRA notation.
 Show detailed information about the package.
 Show list of files in the package.
 Show package source RPM name.
 Display capabilities that the package conflicts with. Same as --qf %{conflicts}.
 Display capabilities enhanced by the package. Same as --qf %{enhances}.

 dnf repoquery --duplicates
 <br><br>Remove older versions of duplicated packages (an equivalent of yum’s package-cleanup –cleandups):
 dnf remove $(dnf repoquery --duplicates --latest-limit -1 -q)
 Repository-Packages Command¶
 <br><br>The repository-packages command allows the user to run commands on top of all packages in the repository named &lt;repoid&gt;. However, any dependency resolution takes into account packages from all enabled repositories. Specifications &lt;package-name-spec&gt; and &lt;package-spec&gt; further limit the candidates to only those packages matching at least one of them.
 <br><br>info subcommand lists description and summary information about packages depending on the packages’ relation to the repository. list subcommand just dumps lists of that packages.
 Non-interactively checks if updates of the specified packages in the repository are available. DNF exit code will be 100 when there are updates available and a list of the updates will be printed.
 List all related packages.
 List packages installed from the repository.
 List packages available in the repository but not currently installed on the system.
 List packages installed from the repository that are not available in any repository.
 List packages in the repository that obsolete packages installed on the system.
 List packages recently added into the repository.
 List packages in the repository that upgrade packages installed on the system.
 Install all packages in the repository.
 List all related packages.
 List packages installed from the repository.
 List packages available in the repository but not currently installed on the system.

 List packages in the repository that obsolete packages installed on the system.
 List packages recently added into the repository.
 List packages in the repository that upgrade packages installed on the system.
 Reinstall all those packages that are available in the repository.
 Run reinstall-old subcommand. If it fails, run move-to subcommand.
 Reinstall all those packages that were installed from the repository and simultaneously are available in the repository.
 Remove all packages installed from the repository along with any packages depending on the packages being removed. If clean_requirements_on_remove is enabled (the default) also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.
 Select all packages installed from the repository. Upgrade, downgrade or keep those of them that are available in another repository to match the latest version available there and remove the others along with any packages depending on the packages being removed. If clean_requirements_on_remove is enabled (the default) also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.
 Select all packages installed from the repository. Reinstall those of them that are available in another repository and remove the others along with any packages depending on the packages being removed. If clean_requirements_on_remove is enabled (the default) also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.
 Update all packages to the highest resolvable version available in the repository.
 Update packages to the specified versions that are available in the repository.
 Search Command¶
 Search package metadata for the keywords. Keywords are matched as case-insensitive substrings, globbing is supported. By default the command will only look at package names and summaries, failing that (or whenever all was given as an argument) it will match against package descriptions and URLs. The result is sorted from the most relevant results to the least.
 <br><br>This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also <a class=reference internal href=#metadata-synchronization-label>Metadata Synchronization</a>.
 Update Command¶
 Deprecated alias for the <a class=reference internal href=#upgrade-command-label>Upgrade Command</a>.
 Updateinfo Command¶
 <p class=first>Display information about update advisories.</p>
 <p>Depending on output type, DNF displays just counts of advisory types
 (omitted or --summary), list of advisories (--list) or detailed
 information (--info). When --info with -v option is used, the
 information is even more detailed.</p>
 <p>&lt;availability&gt; specifies whether advisories about newer versions of
 installed packages (omitted or available), advisories about equal and
 older versions of installed packages (installed), advisories about
 newer versions of those installed packages for which a newer version is
 available (updates) or advisories about any versions of installed
 packages (all) are taken into account. Most of the time, available
 and updates displays the same output. The outputs differ only in the
 cases when an advisory refers to a newer version but there is no enabled
 repository which contains any newer version.</p>
 <p class=last>If given and if neither ID, type (bugfix, enhancement,
 security/sec) nor a package name of an advisory does match
 &lt;spec&gt;, the advisory is not taken into account. The matching is
 case-sensitive and in the case of advisory IDs and package names, globbing
 is supported.</p>
 Upgrade Command¶
 Updates each package to the latest version that is both available and
 resolvable.
 Updates each specified package to the latest available version. Updates
 dependencies as necessary.
 <br><br>See also <a class=reference internal href=#configuration-files-replacement-policy-label>Configuration Files Replacement Policy</a>.
 Upgrade-minimal Command¶
 Updates each package to the latest version that provides bugfix, enhancement
 or fix for security issue (security)
 Updates each specified package to the latest available version that provides
 bugfix, enhancement or fix for security issue (security). Updates
 dependencies as necessary.

 <br><br>Many commands take a &lt;package-spec&gt; parameter that selects a package for the
 operation. DNF looks for interpretations of the parameter from the most commonly
 used meanings to the least, that is it tries to see if the given spec fits one
 of the following patterns (in decreasing order of priority):
 <br><br>Note that name can in general contain dashes (e.g. package-subpackage).
 <br><br>Failing to match the input argument to an existing package name based on the
 patterns above, DNF tries to see if the argument matches an existing provide.
 <br><br>By default, if multiple versions of the selected package exist in the repo, the
 most recent version suitable for the given operation is used. If the selected
 package exists for multiple architectures, the packages which best match the
 system’s architecture will be preferred. The name specification is
 case-sensitive, globbing characters “?, * and [ are allowed and
 trigger shell-like glob matching. If globbing character is present in name,
 DNF expands given name first and consequently selects all packages matching
 expanded &lt;package-spec&gt;.
 <br><br>&lt;package-name-spec&gt; is similar to &lt;package-spec&gt; except the provides
 matching is never attempted there.
 <br><br>&lt;package-installed-specs&gt; is similar to &lt;package-specs&gt; except it
 considers only installed packages.
 "},{"id": 18489,"commandid" : 2448,"title": "Specifying Exact Versions of Packages¶","page": "
 <br><br>Commands accepting the &lt;package-nevr-spec&gt; parameter need not only the name
 of the package, but also its version, release and optionally the
 architecture. Further, the version part can be preceded by an epoch when it is
 relevant (i.e. the epoch is non-zero).
 "},{"id": 18490,"commandid" : 2448,"title": "Specifying Provides¶","page": "
 <br><br>&lt;provide-spec&gt; in command descriptions means the command operates on
 packages providing the given spec. This can either be an explicit provide, an
 implicit provide (i.e. name of the package) or a file provide. The selection is
 case-sensitive and globbing is supported.
 "},{"id": 18491,"commandid" : 2448,"title": "Specifying Groups¶","page": "
 <br><br>&lt;group-spec&gt; allows one to select (environment) groups a particular operation should work
 on. It is a case insensitive string (supporting globbing characters) that is
 matched against a group’s ID, canonical name and name translated into the
 current LC_MESSAGES locale (if possible).
 "},{"id": 18492,"commandid" : 2448,"title": "Specifying Transactions¶","page": "
 <br><br>&lt;transaction-spec&gt; can be in one of several forms. If it is an integer, it
 specifies a transaction ID. Specifying last is the same as specifying the ID
 of the most recent transaction. The last form is last-&lt;offset&gt;, where
 &lt;offset&gt; is a positive integer. It specifies offset-th transaction preceding
 the most recent transaction.
 "},{"id": 18493,"commandid" : 2448,"title": "Metadata Synchronization¶","page": "
 <br><br>Correct operation of DNF depends on having access to up-to-date data from all enabled repositories but contacting remote mirrors on every operation considerably slows it down and costs bandwidth for both the client and the repository provider. The <a class=reference internal href=conf_ref.html#metadata-expire-label>metadata_expire</a> (see dnf.conf(5)) repo config option is used by DNF to determine whether particular local copy of repository data is due to be re-synced. It is crucial that the repository providers set the option well, namely to a value where it is guaranteed that if particular metadata was available in time T on the server, then all packages it references will still be available for download from the server in time T + metadata_expire.
 <br><br>To further reduce the bandwidth load, some of the commands where having up-to-date metadata is not critical (e.g. the list command) do not look at whether a repository is expired and whenever any version of it is locally available, it will be used. Note that in all situations the user can force synchronization of all enabled repositories with the --refresh switch.
 "},{"id": 18494,"commandid" : 2448,"title": "Configuration Files Replacement Policy¶","page": "
 <br><br>The updated packages could replace the old modified configuration files
 with the new ones or keep the older files. Neither of the files are actually replaced.
 To the conflicting ones RPM gives additional suffix to the origin name. Which file
 should maintain the true name after transaction is not controlled by package manager
 but is specified by each package itself, following packaging guideline.
