# TLDR

**Create archive**

```7z a [archive.7z] [files...]```

**Extract archive**

```7z x [archive.7z]```

**Extract to specific directory**

```7z x [archive.7z] -o[directory]```

**List archive contents**

```7z l [archive.7z]```

**Test archive integrity**

```7z t [archive.7z]```

**Create with password**

```7z a -p[password] [archive.7z] [files]```

**Create with maximum compression**

```7z a -mx=9 [archive.7z] [files]```

# DESCRIPTION

**7z** is the command-line interface to the 7-Zip archiver, supporting many formats: 7z, ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, XZ, and more.

The 7z format offers high compression ratios using LZMA/LZMA2 algorithms, often 30-70% better than ZIP. It also supports AES-256 encryption and multi-volume archives.

Extraction supports many additional formats including RAR, CAB, ISO, and others (read-only for some formats).

# CAVEATS

The 7z format is not as universally supported as ZIP. Consider ZIP for maximum compatibility.

**-o** has no space: **-o/path** not **-o /path**.

RAR creation requires separate RAR tools. 7z can only extract RAR files.

Split archives (**-v**) require all volumes for extraction.
