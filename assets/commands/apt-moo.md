# TLDR

Print a **cow easter egg**

```apt moo```

# SYNOPSIS

**apt moo**

# DESCRIPTION

**apt moo** is a classic APT easter egg that displays an ASCII art cow. It is a playful reference to the **cowsay** program and has been included in APT for many years.

The output varies slightly between APT versions and may display different messages or art depending on the implementation.

# HISTORY

The moo easter egg has been part of APT since the early 2000s. It was inspired by the Debian culture of including playful hidden features in software. Running **apt-get moo** produces a different message stating "This APT has Super Cow Powers" without showing the cow.
