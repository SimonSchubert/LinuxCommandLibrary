It displays stars, constellations, and other astronomical objects based on the observer's location and time, providing an interactive planetarium experience without a graphical desktop environment.

# CAVEATS

Requires a terminal with Unicode and 256-color or truecolor support for proper rendering. Display quality depends on terminal size and font.
