**chars** [_options_] [_character_]

# DESCRIPTION

**chars** is a command-line tool for displaying detailed information about Unicode characters. Given a character, it shows the code point, official Unicode name, general category, block, and other properties.

The search functionality allows finding characters by name, making it useful for locating specific symbols, emoji, or special characters without leaving the terminal. It is a lightweight alternative to graphical character map utilities for developers and anyone working with Unicode text or debugging encoding issues.
