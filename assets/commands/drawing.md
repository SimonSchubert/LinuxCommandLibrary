# DESCRIPTION

**drawing** is a simple raster image editor designed for the GNOME desktop environment. It provides basic drawing and editing tools including pencil, eraser, line, arc, shapes, text, and selection tools with crop, scale, and rotate capabilities.

The application fills the gap between basic screenshot annotation and full-featured image editors like GIMP. It's ideal for quick image edits, adding arrows and text to screenshots, creating simple diagrams, or making basic modifications to existing images.
