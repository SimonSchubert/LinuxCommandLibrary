# SYNOPSIS

**gemtopbm** [_input_]

# DESCRIPTION

**gemtopbm** is a format conversion utility that converts GEM IMG format images to PBM (Portable Bitmap) format. GEM IMG was the native bitmap image format used by Digital Research's GEM (Graphics Environment Manager) operating system and desktop environment, popular in the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly on Atari ST computers.

The tool is part of the Netpbm suite of image conversion utilities, enabling integration of legacy GEM images into modern workflows. By converting to PBM, a simple portable format, GEM images can then be further processed or converted to contemporary formats using other Netpbm tools.

This converter is primarily useful for digital preservation, retro computing enthusiasts, and anyone working with historical computer graphics from the GEM era.
