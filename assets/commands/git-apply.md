# DESCRIPTION

**git apply** applies patches to files and/or the index. Unlike git am, it works with raw diff output without email formatting, making it suitable for patches generated by git diff.

The command can apply patches to the working tree, index, or both. It supports checking patches without applying and showing statistics. Reverse application enables undoing patches.

git apply handles unified diff format patches for code changes.

# CAVEATS

Does not create commits. Use git am for patch series. May fail on binary files without appropriate handling.

# HISTORY

git apply is a core **Git** command for patch application, providing lower-level functionality than git am.
