# TLDR

**Open CI page in browser**

```git browse-ci```

# SYNOPSIS

**git** **browse-ci**

# DESCRIPTION

**git browse-ci** is a git-extras utility that automatically detects your repository's CI/CD system and opens the appropriate pipeline or workflow page in your web browser. It intelligently recognizes and constructs URLs for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI, and other popular continuous integration platforms.

The command saves time by eliminating the need to navigate through repository web interfaces to find build status and pipeline runs. It detects the CI system based on repository configuration and remote URL, then opens directly to the relevant CI dashboard.

This is particularly useful for quickly checking build status, reviewing test results, or investigating CI failures without leaving the terminal.
