# SYNOPSIS

**git** **paste** _file_

# DESCRIPTION

**git paste** creates a GitHub Gist from a file. This git-extras command uploads file content to GitHub Gist and returns the Gist URL for easy sharing of code snippets, configuration files, or logs.

The command handles authentication through GitHub credentials and integrates gist creation directly into the Git workflow, eliminating the need to visit the GitHub web interface for quick file sharing.
