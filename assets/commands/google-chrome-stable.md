# DESCRIPTION

**google-chrome-stable** is the command-line launcher for Google Chrome, the stable release version of Google's web browser. It shares most functionality with the open-source Chromium browser but includes Google-specific features like automatic updates, proprietary codecs, and integration with Google services.

Common command-line options are identical to Chromium, including headless mode, remote debugging, user profile management, and various flags for development and testing.

The command name varies by system: **google-chrome**, **google-chrome-stable**, or simply **chrome** may be available depending on the installation.
