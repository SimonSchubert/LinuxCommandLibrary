# TAGLINE

Search PyPI for packages (deprecated)

# TLDR

**Search for packages**

```pip search [query]```

# SYNOPSIS

**pip** **search** _query_

# DESCRIPTION

**pip search** searched for packages on PyPI by name or description. This command has been disabled on PyPI since late 2020 due to excessive resource usage from automated queries.

# CAVEATS

This command no longer works. PyPI disabled the XML-RPC search endpoint. Search for packages directly at pypi.org instead.
