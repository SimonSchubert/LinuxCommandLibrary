# DESCRIPTION

**pip** is the package installer for Python, used to install and manage packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other repositories. It handles dependency resolution, downloading, and installation of Python packages.

Packages can be installed globally (requires root), per-user with **--user**, or in virtual environments (recommended). Version specifiers allow precise control: **==** for exact, **>=** for minimum, **~=** for compatible versions.

The **requirements.txt** format, generated by **pip freeze**, records exact versions for reproducible installations. Modern Python recommends using **python -m pip** instead of the bare **pip** command to ensure the correct Python interpreter is used.

# CAVEATS

On Linux systems, avoid using pip with sudo to install packages globally as it can conflict with system packages. Use virtual environments or **--user** instead. Some distributions rename pip to **pip3** for Python 3. The search command was disabled on PyPI due to abuse. Package installation may require compilation and build dependencies.

# HISTORY

pip was created by **Ian Bicking** and first released in **2008** as a replacement for easy_install. The name is a recursive acronym: "**p**ip **i**nstalls **p**ackages". It became the standard Python package manager, included by default with Python since version 3.4. The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) now maintains pip, continuously improving dependency resolution, security, and performance.
