# SYNOPSIS

**pirut**

# DESCRIPTION

**pirut** is a graphical frontend for the yum package manager on older Fedora and Red Hat systems. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, installing, and removing packages.

The tool presents packages organized by categories and allows users to manage system software without using command-line tools.

# CAVEATS

Legacy tool, not available on modern Fedora/RHEL systems. Replaced by GNOME Software, dnfdragora, or dnf command line. Requires X11 display.

# HISTORY

**pirut** was the default graphical package manager in early Fedora releases (Fedora Core 5-6 era). It was superseded by PackageKit-based tools and eventually GNOME Software as Fedora modernized its desktop software management.
