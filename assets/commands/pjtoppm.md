**pjtoppm** [_file_]

# DESCRIPTION

**pjtoppm** converts images in HP PaintJet printer format to PPM (Portable Pixmap). It reads the PaintJet raster data from a file or stdin and outputs a standard PPM image that can be processed by other Netpbm tools or image editors.

This is part of the Netpbm image conversion toolkit, which provides converters between dozens of image formats using PPM as an intermediate representation.
