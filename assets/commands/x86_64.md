# SYNOPSIS

**x86_64** [_options_] [_program_ [_arguments_]]

# DESCRIPTION

**x86_64** is a symlink to **setarch** that runs a program with the reported architecture set to x86_64. It is equivalent to running **setarch x86_64**.

This is typically used on 64-bit systems to ensure programs detect and run in 64-bit mode, though on native x86_64 systems this is usually the default behavior.
