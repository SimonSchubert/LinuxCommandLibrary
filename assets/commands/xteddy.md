**xteddy** is a classic X11 desktop toy that displays a teddy bear image in a shaped, borderless window. The bear can be dragged around the screen with the mouse, serving as a whimsical desktop companion. Clicking the teddy bear exits the program.

Custom images can be provided with the **-f** option, allowing any PNG image to be used instead of the default teddy bear. The program is a lighthearted example of X11's shaped window capabilities and remains a nostalgic curiosity from the early days of desktop customization.
