Go through all linux commands one by one in commands.txt and improve the markdown file in assets/commands

Extensively analyze if the data is truthful. Use official command/project documentation, official man pages and the source code itself. Analyze which important and useful information is missing.

Edit the existing markdown file with those changes. The existing markdown structure is already good, keep the structure and fluent readable text where possible. You are allowed to add complicity new sections if it is filled with useful and not repetitive information.
